At the time of hiring they were not aware of their status. I understand that not all sex offenses are the same and offenders are under no obligation to disclose. My issue is, at some point a few years ago an anonymous email was sent to the owner and it disclosed his status. They had a sit down meeting and he explained everything away and no one else did any further research.\n  Fast forward he was given a promotion and put in charge of minors unsupervised and his charges are 2 separate offenses of sexual exploitation of a minor in the second degree, and then reoffends in the third degree 3 years later. No one seems concerned beyond their own personal comfort. Is there a case for negligent retention, unsafe work? Idk it bothers me so much. He\u0027s always taken an interest I\u0027m the young employees but the owners knows AND CONTINUES to give this man chance after chance. Any advice is welcome I\u0027m in SC.",

I recently found out that my job (small little franchise restaurant so no HR or anything like that) hired a SO. At the time of hiring they were not aware of their status. I understand that not all sex offenses are the same and offenders are under no obligation to disclose. My issue is, at some point a few years ago an anonymous email was sent to the owner and it disclosed his status. They had a sit down meeting and he explained everything away and no one else did any further research.\n  Fast forward he was given a promotion and put in charge of minors unsupervised and his charges are 2 separate offenses of sexual exploitation of a minor in the second degree, and then reoffends in the third degree 3 years later. No one seems concerned beyond their own personal comfort. Is there a case for negligent retention, unsafe work? Idk it bothers me so much. He\u0026amp;#39;s always taken an interest I\u0026amp;#39;m the young employees but the owners knows AND CONTINUES to give this man chance after chance. Any advice is welcome I\u0026amp;#39;m in SC.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

I ended up having it in for just over four months. Within a week of placement was having the worst migraines of my life. I mentioned it at the followup, but they said to give it time. Migraines reduced, but then were replaced by a feeling of near-constant fullness or pressure in my head that came with vision changes, nausea, dizziness, brain fog, head and neck pain that seemed to be worse in the back of my head. My blood pressure was also going up, as were my eye pressures. Mentioned this and was again told to give it time. Started having swelling in my legs as well as the other problems worsening. It had also made it to where I was bleeding and cramping three weeks out of a month (light bleeding but still troublesome). I told them I wanted it out, and at the appointment I made they again said to give it time. I insisted I wanted it gone. \n\nI have been on medical leave for a month and a half because even after it was removed, I am still having intermittent issues with my vision and the feeling of pressure (which still comes with dizziness, nausea, and head/neck pain). \n\nIf it makes any difference, I have multiple sclerosis, so they thought it might have been a new lesion. MRI did not show this or any evidence of intracranial pressure. These are not typical for my disease progression and only manifested after Mirena, so my neurologist does not feel it\u0027s a result of MS.

The house is paid off BTW, just have to pay property taxes each quarter and of course bills to keep lights on etc. Of course the house would go to my mother first, then after her passing, it would become my home. Now my grandmother died a few years ago and my mother never moved into the house because she was in the hospital with cancer and she later died just five months later. I would assume that legally this would mean the house belongs to my father because they were married but I don\u0027t know... After Granma died there was never a meeting I know of declaring the house belongs to my mother and no will disbursement, although I am 99% certain my grandmother had a will because she had all of her death affairs in order and paid for 20 years before she died, down to what makeup she would wear during her funeral. \nAnyway, shortly after my mother died, my brother and his girlfriend found they were pregnant with their second child and they asked ME if it was okay if they could live there as they knew it was supposed to be my home and they needed a cheaper place to live with new baby coming. I said yes but I wanted my dad to write a letter saying they would move out by five years and that if the house was sold we would split it three ways. My dad never did this, and while I am okay that they are still living there and my brother is supposedly been paying the property taxes for the past five years, I am afraid that he will eventually sell the house and keep all the money. He has basically said as much because prior to him moving in he redid two or three floors and painted some walls and fixed it up a little. \nI tried to explain to him that that was all for his benefit and I was allowing him to live there for free all these years but he is just calling me selfish. \nOne time I overheard his girlfriend saying they would try to pull squatters rights if it came down to it. I don\u0027t want to kick them out and unhome them, but I find it unfair that they have lived in a house rent free for five years and may sell it and give me nothing, when the entire family knows this home was supposed to end up in my possession, but I have no paperwork proving this and don\u0027t know how to go about getting it. BTW, my grandmother\u0027s lawyer died as well. Are wills public records that I can easily find? What can I do about this? Is the house still legally my dad\u0027s even though my brother has been paying the property taxes? ",

Fast forward to today I receive some mail from a debt collection agency saying that I owe them 2314$ and that I had an account with them for a service(I never signed anything or had anything to do with this towing company) what do I need to do? i\u0026amp;#39;m afraid of this affecting my credit. I\u0026amp;#39;m tired of being harassed over a car I don\u0026amp;#39;t own anymore. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

I work from home and value privacy overall, all of these incidents have caused disruption while working and they\u0027ve happened in a short time span. The landlord has outright disagreed that they have even violated the lease, claiming they didn\u2019t enter the interior of the home. They show no remorse for invading our privacy and even told us in writing they can\u0027t guarantee it won\u2019t happen again.\n\n\n\nThe other problems may seem more minor on their own, but I hope they help strengthen my case since we\u2019ve had continuous problems with this landlord. I\u0027ve read MN has a better reputation for siding with tenants and their laws are a little more tenant friendly. \n\n\n\nRenting Details:\n\n   \\- The Relevant lease section that mentions \u0022premises\u0022\n\n3.2 INSPECTION OF PREMISES AND RIGHT OF ENTRY\n\n1. Upon providing the Tenant(s) with 24 hours notice, the Owner or Owner\u0027s designee, may enter\n\nPremises for any reasonable business purpose, including to inspect the Premises periodically.\n\n\n\n\\- Lease duration at the current property: 4 out of 12 months\n\n\\- Single-family home\n\n\\- Single lease , no other tenants / not a shared yard or common area\n\n\\- The property has what I feel is a moderately private backyard, with entry only on one side of the house, and access is only possible by passing through the grass.\n\n\n\nPrivacy Violations\n\n\n\nFirst Incident:\n\nA maintenance worker entered the backyard several days after an initial maintenance visit. No prior notice was given before this entry.\n\nFollowing this incident, I communicated with the landlord, requesting that they provide proper notice before any future entries onto the property.\n\n\n\nSecond Incident:\n\nA leasing associate entered the backyard without prior notice to retrieve a lockbox.\n\nNo advance communication was provided about this entry, despite my prior request for notice.\n\n\n\nThird Incident:\n\nA contractor from a pest control service entered the backyard without notice to check bait stations as part of a pest control service contract. They made loud noises and even moved a branch in the backyard.\n\n\n\nMissing Microwave\n\n\n\nLease Obligation: The lease listed a microwave as one of the appliances provided with the rental.\n\nStatus: No microwave was present in the unit when I moved in, and the landlord has not provided one since.\n\n\n\nDelayed Move-In and Tenant Expenses\n\n\n\nMove-In Day: On the initial move-in day, I was unable to access the property due to ongoing maintenance work.\n\nCompensation: The landlord prorated one day of rent to compensate for the delay after we requested but it didn\u0027t cover other moving delay expenses. \n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Refrigerator Issue\n\n\n\nPresence of Refrigerator: A second refrigerator was on the property but was not listed in the lease.\n\nMaintenance Attempts: The landlord attempted to repair the refrigerator but did not approve a replacement, leaving it unusable for several months.\n\n\n\nPrior Leasing Background\n\n\n\nPrevious Lease Non-Renewal: I previously rented from this landlord and was not offered a renewal.\n\nRe-Rental at Increased Rate: The landlord subsequently re-rented the previous unit at a higher monthly rate after I moved out.\n\nTiming of New Lease: I did not become aware of the re-rented price increase until after I had already signed a new lease with the landlord at a different property. (If I had known I would never had rented from then again as they forced us to move and didn\u0027t even offer us the new price). ",

My wife works at an Indian casino and had a slip and fall due to negligence inside the employee only cafeteria. Long story short, there were no wet floor signs, a handful of witnesses came to help her up, security came and wrote a report. The casino employees had to dry the floor with a towel attached to a mop handle and they added the signs as they were caring for my wife. This happened prior to my wife clocking in for her shift. The casino drove my wife to see their doctor, who put her out of work for a week, and she was to follow up in a week. While she was off for the week, the casino sent her a letter stating that since she was not clocked in, they\u2019re denying her for workers comp and that she could no longer see their doctor unless we paid for it. On our own, we applied for disability, but my wife just returned back to work after not working for 16 years because she stayed home with our young children, so she hasn\u2019t payed enough into disability to qualify.  Since the workers comp denial, she\u2019s been off for a month, and is off until December per her PCP. \n\nShe had pre existing back  issues (disc bulge) that was resolved with PT, acupuncture, and weight loss. Since the fall, she\u2019s experienced numbness in her legs and mechanical issues with her knees. She did have an MRI post fall and the disc bulge measured the same as 4 years ago.  Does the eggshell skull tort apply to her? We\u2019re worried because she has no income, she won\u2019t be able to return to work anytime soon.  Do we have a case against the casino? If we do, would it be workers comp or a liability/PI case? Thank you in advance. ",

I want to be a bigger part of their lives.  \n\nI fear my ex being the narcissist that she is is going to make a legal battle difficult but what are my options here and If I get told I can get them and then they make plans later that night can I get in trouble for ignoring their plans? \n\nI\u2019ve considered putting myself on child support for them to force time sharing but I\u2019m struggling financially as it is and have other kids that live with me so I don\u2019t think I could even afford for that money. \n\nMy spouse now says I should get a lawyer but I\u2019m very afraid of this going wrong and them retaliating by making me even less of a part of their lives.

I\u2019m trying to do my best to stay civil because things got really ugly with us when we were together but this is really starting to hurt.

Did some pre field work 12:30-1:30 then rode in a managers car into the field from 2-8pm, often later, with no breaks, access to food, or restrooms since we left our own vehicles at the office. We\u2019d get back to the office and review our day and by that time it was 9pm-11pm. Saturdays were short days 9am-4pm. \n\nOn one of our lunch breaks I was late to return. I came back at about 12:35 and my supervisor spoke to me about it in a private room for disciplinary action and a warning but provided nothing in writing when I asked. \n\nI was eventually let go for performance. Which I had absolutely no problem with as we were working 60\u002B hours a week making less than minimum wage. \n\nThere were a few strange things with the paycheck. The training just said commission with no breakdown. The sales I had also said commission, no breakdown, no account number, no quantity of sales, no customer name, etc. \n\nSince I left I applied for another sales job in the same field. It turns out that it\u2019s a sister company. The only difference is that it\u2019s B2B instead of B2C so the field hours are 9-5 M-F and the overall schedule is 8am-7pm, Saturdays 9-4. \n\nFrom my past w-2 100% commission jobs we transitioned to 1099s for a couple reasons: I was told that 1099s can\u2019t be mandated to attend meetings. And for tax purposes we were mis categorized as w-2s when the job fell into a 1099 role and we needed to be on an hourly wage if we were going to be w-2s. \n\nIt really seems that these sister companies are not meeting minimum wage base pay and I\u2019d really like to see people get paid appropriately, especially management as they come in earlier, leave later and are at 70\u002B hours a week and are barely getting by. \n\nI would really like to do something while being employed for the B2B sister company as I\u2019m sure different laws apply while being employed as opposed to not being employed. \n\nAm I within my legal right to be paid a minimum wage? Are these companies in the right by mandating so much work without a guaranteed base pay? I\u2019ve spoken with different labor attorneys at the same firm and have gotten different responses. I\u2019d just like to see if anyone has any similar experience on either end of this. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTLDR: I was at a door to door sales job that pays 100% commission with a mandated schedule that pays way less than minimum wage, in fact you\u2019re guaranteed half of minimum wage age for training .\n\nIs this legal and what legal action, if any, should I take? \n\n\n",

I\u2019d just like to see if anyone has any similar experience on either end of this. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;TLDR: I was at a door to door sales job that pays 100% commission with a mandated schedule that pays way less than minimum wage, in fact you\u2019re guaranteed half of minimum wage age for training .\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Is this legal and what legal action, if any, should I take? \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

Jurisdiction for the individuals involved in this are Hillsborough, Polk, and Osceola Counties, Florida.\n\nI recently became the durable power of attorney for an \u002B80year friend (E.S.) with no next of kin when my friend (S.F.) who previously held this role passed earlier this year. To complicate matters E.S. is in memory care with irrecoverable dementia, Hospice, and has cardiac and vascular issues that have her bed ridden and considered physically and mentally incapacitated. These are all physician documented states.\n\nPrior to her designation of incapacity and over a year earlier E.S. started having issues with her financial advisor, \u0022Captain Asshole\u0022 (C.A.), the name given to him by S.F. Primary issues was C.A.  was blocking regular transactions associated with the bulk of her estate, changed beneficiaries on the accounts, donated monies to a religious organization with which he was treasurer, and preventing any online access to her accounts.  The dominant issue in E.S. grievance with C.A. being the accounts were being used to pay for care, housing, and quality of life expenses.  This prompted E.S. to hire a Family Attorney to draft a trust and other supporting legal documents to clearly define her estate directives, as well as, health and financial durable POAs.  These documents were clearly instructed by her attorney to her financial institution to place all her assets under trust. C.A. ignored her request to reassign her accounts under trust and continued to trade on the accounts without and against E.S. directive.  This prompted E.S. to fire C.A. in a certified letter, email, and a copy of which was also transmitted to the corporate offices complaints department. Unfortunately, nothing happening again and a letter being transmitted from the institution to E.S. stating that her accounts were locked because of suspicion of fraud.  Two Florida DCF complaints in two separate counties (Polk and Oceola) over 3 month were filed by C.A. on S.F. in what I believe was an effort to try and substantiate the fraud lock on the accounts.  Both investigations were dropped and no evidence of fraud was found. This obviously upset E.S. and S.F. and they established new accounts with a new Financial institution and financial advisor group.  Associated FINRA, SEC, \u0026amp; Florida Attorney General Complaints were filed, and a criminal lawyer was hired to write a letter of complaint to the institution.  The lawyer was a dead end because hes was not capable of navigating the FINRA and SEC actions and the amount was too small to warrant a specialized attorney to accept the case.  Although some difficulty was presented by C.A. eventually \\~98% of the assets transferred to the new institution with the exception of two mutual funds that could not transfer \u0022in kind\u0022 as the receiving institution was not set up to be a custodian to those funds. Usually, those assets are sold and the cash proceeds are transferred.  In typical fashion C.A. blocked that and the funds still remain in that original account.\n\nThe health of S.F. prior to any of this was bad, Cancer, and continued to decline over the period when the bulk of assets transferred and the remaining were blocked.  She did not pursue the matter over several months due to her declining health and expired as a result of her illness.  I started getting involved prior to S.F. passing, and when authorized I went about organizing and updating all of E.S.\u0027s financial and health providers.  When I contacted the problematic financial institution with my POA documents and tried to sell and transfer the remaining 2% of assets they were, as previously addressed, ignored.  I contacted the complaints department and submitted the same POA and supporting documents accepted by all the other institutions. I was told by the corporate complaints department, without a reason, that they were not adequate by the financial institutions legal department. When I asked for an explanation none was given over 48hrs and multiple requests on my part.  It is my assumption that they are trying to run out the clock and I\u0027m not concerned about the cash value but not having to go through probate if the assets remained as individual and are not place under trust.  It\u0027s an expense and pain I would rather not assume given my non-paid role as POA.\n\nI\u0027ve updated the complaint with FL AG, need to follow up with the FINRA and SEC complaints and was rejected a DCF investigation for lack of sufficient cause. At this point I want to make this guy, Captain Asshole, miserable and deny any possibility of continued or future benefit from these remaining assets.\n\nApologize for the long drawn out story and this brings me to the question I have.  What other action aside from hiring an attorney to sue C.A. and his institution for the remaining assets should I pursue?  My primary desire is for them to transfer the assets or cash to her new financial institution.\n\nThanks for reading.  If nothing else this was a way for me to organize my thoughts.",

The carrier (Berkshire Hathaway/BiBerk) indicated that it was because I\u0027d failed to provide all of the required documentation for this past year\u0027s audit.  This was not true, as I even had a confirmation email sent by the premium audit department acknowledging receipt of my documents.\n\nMeanwhile, and without me even knowing that my policy did not renew, I had an employee who had initially resigned from my company, but then contacted us about a week or so later indicating that something with the new job didn\u0027t work out.  We were able to give him a part-time fill-in position and on his very first day back he claims that he tripped on the sidewalk while out in the community with a client, suffered a torn quadriceps tendon, and needed to file a Workers Comp claim.  That is when I learned that my policy was no longer active.  The lapse in coverage was not even 30 days, but in that tiny window is when the employee was injured.  I\u0027m sick about it.\n\nI did immediately obtain a new Workers Comp policy and am working with an attorney on this, but I am really worried about what my financial liability might be here.  My attorney sent me an email at the end of the day yesterday so that I had to go into this weekend without any answers and with a lot of concerns.\n\nWhat I can tell you thus far is that the former employee did require a surgery for the torn quadriceps tendon, has been without work since May, and is attempting to claim total disability.  I\u0027m not sure if this is enough information for anyone to attempt to quantify even an estimate of what my total financial liability might be or what kind of arrangement I might be able to make with the UEGF, if any.  \n\nThanks in advance and pardon the lengthy post.",

The carrier (Berkshire Hathaway/BiBerk) indicated that it was because I\u0026amp;#39;d failed to provide all of the required documentation for this past year\u0026amp;#39;s audit.  This was not true, as I even had a confirmation email sent by the premium audit department acknowledging receipt of my documents.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Meanwhile, and without me even knowing that my policy did not renew, I had an employee who had initially resigned from my company, but then contacted us about a week or so later indicating that something with the new job didn\u0026amp;#39;t work out.  We were able to give him a part-time fill-in position and on his very first day back he claims that he tripped on the sidewalk while out in the community with a client, suffered a torn quadriceps tendon, and needed to file a Workers Comp claim.  That is when I learned that my policy was no longer active.  The lapse in coverage was not even 30 days, but in that tiny window is when the employee was injured.  I\u0026amp;#39;m sick about it.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I did immediately obtain a new Workers Comp policy and am working with an attorney on this, but I am really worried about what my financial liability might be here.  My attorney sent me an email at the end of the day yesterday so that I had to go into this weekend without any answers and with a lot of concerns.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;What I can tell you thus far is that the former employee did require a surgery for the torn quadriceps tendon, has been without work since May, and is attempting to claim total disability.  I\u0026amp;#39;m not sure if this is enough information for anyone to attempt to quantify even an estimate of what my total financial liability might be or what kind of arrangement I might be able to make with the UEGF, if any.  \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Thanks in advance and pardon the lengthy post.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

So I\u0026amp;#39;ve been at a job for 3 years and have an interesting issue. So I\u0026amp;#39;ve been eligible for health insurance after my first six months. Every enrollment period my job tells me \u0026amp;quot;they don\u0026amp;#39;t know when sign up is\u0026amp;quot; and that I\u0026amp;#39;ll get a packet in the mail. I have never received anything for me to sign up. I need health care and am at a total loss on how to proceed with the job. Thanks for advice in advance!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

I had already asked Medicare themselves and they cleared me, but I wanted an official attorney of Healthcare Law to put their stamp of approval.\n\nHe returned an email that said \u0022no problem, don\u0027t have the answer right now, but should be about $2,500.00 and a couple of hours of research (probably much less, but don\u0027t want you to be surprised).\n\nI agreed, signed an engagement letter that had the company hourly rates and moved forward.\n\nWithout any acknowledgement, the lawyer sent me an invoice of $13,250, and said he even marked off hours.  I sent him an email back saying this was not what we agreed on, had I known it was going to be this much, I would have not moved forward and just rejected the 2 surgeon\u0027s proposals and stayed with my current business model.\n\nI explained that the whole reason I moved forward was he was a healthcare lawyer and I figured he would have the answers within reach based on his confident email that said \u00222,500 or less.\u0022  And I did not authorize anyone to go way over that.\n\nI\u0027m a small business. I can\u0027t pay 13,250.00 and though I respect him for his work and diligence, I feel like I\u0027m not the one being unreasonable in this situation.  I put aside double the amount of his high estimate in case he went over, but in no way shape or form can pay 13,250.00.\n\nHe said he\u0027d think about it over the weekend, but I feel like I have an EMAIL from HIM stating 2,500 or less.

            "selftext": "\nI desperately need help knowing if i have any rights before i try to hire a lawyer. My mother passed 09/28/21. My uncle and grandfather came down to say goodbye. I trusted my uncle a lot at that time despite his past because he seemed to care so deeply. He found the funeral home and asked my brother and I to come down to sign paperwork so we could have my mom cremated since we were next of kin. My brother was supposed to pick up the ashes due to my brother living in GA (she passed in Anderson, SC) and me being a live in nanny in Hawaii at the time. My uncle said he was paying a majority of the fees for the ashes since I was 19 at the time and bother was 22. He then went and picked up the ashes and took them to his home state of MO without us knowing. Turns out he didn\u2019t pay, my awful, lying aunt did (These are people who treated my mother like crap and encourage and facilitated her addiction because of their hate for her) my uncle then held them hostage for 3 years and whenever I asked for some I\u2019d be told to \u201Chave some strength and patience for once in my life\u201D and that \u201CI didn\u2019t understand my uncles past\u201D by my grandma on my late mothers side. His past consisted of multiple arrests and DUI\u2019s. In January he was caught trying to pick up a minor for sex. He is currently awaiting trial but at home on what I am assuming is house arrest due to his arrest records. I only found this out after arguing my grandmother about why she kept putting off spreading my mother\u2019s ashes (it didn\u2019t matter what my mom wanted, only my grandma) and never asking my brother or I what we/ she wanted. She then admitted the truth they had all been hiding from me (they think he was \u201Cset up\u201D and it\u2019s all \u201Cfake\u201D\uD83D\uDE44). She had told me I couldn\u2019t have any of my mom\u2019s ashes until they spread them due to my uncles \u201Cfeelings\u201D.  He was supposedly deeply uncomfortable with my mom\u2019s ashes being split prior to spreading because someone could end up with \u201Cher whole leg!\u201D?!? Anyways I finally got her to agree if my brother and I paid my aunt $2k (more than the ashes cost according to the funeral home) we could have them. I said I\u2019d send the money right then. My bother sent me $1k and my boyfriend said he\u2019d lend the other half without me asking. Suddenly her story changed and she had to ask my aunt how she felt? This is the same woman who never spoke to my mom other than to make her feel awful and send her back into a spiral and encourage it. I\u2019ve heard it and seen it all. Anyways ( sorry for so much backstory) after saying that and telling my grandma I would drive up to MO to pick up the ashes because I wasn\u2019t comfortable for the ashes to be mailed, she had them secretly mailed to her. I genuinely think if she had agreed to have them mailed she\u2019d send me fake ashes and lie. So does my whole family on both sides. My father said maybe I could put the ashes in a trust with the condition that once paid I get them, and I would have them tested to see if they are human remains or not. Well today so called to check in on my grandma and realized she had blocked me on FB. She then lied and said she deleted her FB. My boyfriend was able to prove that was a lie by looking her up on FB. The only reason I can assume she and my aunt would block me but still pick up my calls and talk to me like they care (they\u2019ve made it clear since my mom passed I\u2019m not family and simply play the whole \u201Coh noooo i lost my daughter/ sister and it\u2019s so awful!\u201D (they never checked on my brother or I once after she passed, just threatened to sue me after I wouldn\u2019t hand over all my moms belongings to them. I was next of kin so I was told legally all her possessions are mine and his due to her having no will and no husband. My grandma even tried to call the hospital and say that my mom had no kids so she could make all the decisions!!!) and I finally realized the only reason they\u2019d block me is because they either spread her ashes or did something with them I would not be okay with. I guess after all this rambling my question is, what are my rights? What can I sue/ take her to court for? For the ashes? For emotional damages? I\u2019m so sorry to post such a long crazy post but I am DONE. I only let her back into my life thinking it was what my mom would have wanted. I no longer care and know my mother wouldn\u2019t support them in how they\u2019ve treated me/ how they\u2019ve supported someone clearly caught trying to pick up a 13 year old for very very very disgusting illegal things. I just need to know if I have ANY rights at all. I have played nice because of my mom and what she would want and hoped I could have any piece of my mother. What kills me the most is hearing my grandma say that her brother did the same to her with her mothers ashes and yet she sees it fir to do it to me. I\u2019m so sorry for the long post, I just felt the full story was needed to understand the severity of the situation. I apologize for any grammatical errors. ",

Emily pays the vet bills, insurance, pays for the food and all the other things but the dogs chip is registered to the gf.

My wife had been staying with a friend at a hotel in Texas when, at 2AM, a unidentified man began banging on their door, cursing profusely, and made multiple attempts to break in.  Concierge did not answer the phone, so they called 911.\n\nBy the time police arrived, the man had fled, but the police would not escort them out of the hotel because it was at that point considered non-emergency.\n\nAfter the police left, the man returned, again banging and cursing, lurking around the door for the next several hours (seeing the shadows under the door).\n\nMy wife made contact with me begging me to contact concierge, who I was also unable to reach.  I had to go through the general hotel number to finally get to the front desk.  When connected I was told there were no security cameras and security only makes rounds, but doesn\u0027t attend to disturbances. I was absolutely shocked.\n\nLong story short, my wife and her friend somehow got out and determined that the security guard (who was drunk and smelled of pot) was the one who caused all of this.  Apparently they had also had a passing conversation while my wife and friend were headed up to the room, so he knew who they were and where they were staying. Out of fear, they chose to end their stay. Additionally also abandon a conference that was at the hotel out of fears of safety.\n\nLastly, they booked emergency flights home at their own expense.\n\nThis is the first time this kind of thing has ever happened to us.  We are shaken to the core, and it seems like irresponsibility on the hotel\u0027s side exacerbated a potentially disastrous situation. Please help me know how best to proceed with this and if I should be pursing any kind of legal route.\n\nThank you all truly in advance.",

I had just announced about a month ago that I was pregnant and my office manager immediately called the owner and told him I was pregnant (which I was planning on telling him myself) and told him she will start looking for someone to cover my maternity leave. She asked me when I was leaving and I told her I had no idea that me and my boyfriend haven\u2019t discussed it yet. I asked her how maternity leave works and how long do I get, she said to just let her know when and that I can take as long as I want. \n\nNot too long after, we already had working interviews coming in, and after the 3rd WI, she was hired and scheduled to start on 10/14. She ended up having something come up and started last Monday. A week before she started, OM moved me to the sister location telling me she wanted me to have less stress during my pregnancy. Which she originally told me my coworker was going to be moved over there, since I am the main front office at this location.\n\n The next day after the new hire started, I had just arrived to work and was about to get out of my car, when OM calls me and asks if I was at work already, I told her yes that I had just arrived (7:30amish) and apologizes saying she was suppose to call me yesterday to let me know that I was being let go.  She had just gotten busy and that she forgot.

I had just announced about a month ago that I was pregnant and my office manager immediately called the owner and told him I was pregnant (which I was planning on telling him myself) and told him she will start looking for someone to cover my maternity leave. She asked me when I was leaving and I told her I had no idea that me and my boyfriend haven\u2019t discussed it yet. I asked her how maternity leave works and how long do I get, she said to just let her know when and that I can take as long as I want. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Not too long after, we already had working interviews coming in, and after the 3rd WI, she was hired and scheduled to start on 10/14. She ended up having something come up and started last Monday. A week before she started, OM moved me to the sister location telling me she wanted me to have less stress during my pregnancy. Which she originally told me my coworker was going to be moved over there, since I am the main front office at this location.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The next day after the new hire started, I had just arrived to work and was about to get out of my car, when OM calls me and asks if I was at work already, I told her yes that I had just arrived (7:30amish) and apologizes saying she was suppose to call me yesterday to let me know that I was being let go.  She had just gotten busy and that she forgot. Saying that the owner spoke her the day before to tell her that he wanted to let me go. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;She said there have been a lot of mistakes, and that she\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s my hormones or what but that I have stopped caring, that I don\u2019t accept criticism the same way, and that the owner said I was acting different, that I was just there at work and not present, and he even asked if I was ok, and that he just noticed something different. I asked what I was doing wrong, especially at the main office and she didn\u2019t exactly give me straight answers except repeated what I wrote above.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I started crying and was asking to please help me understand why I was being fired. And she said she said she felt bad, saying that she hates this part of the job and that she likes me as a person and that she was going to try to talk to the owner to see if he will reconsider but that once he makes up his mind about something he won\u2019t change it. She then needed up getting a phone call from her school and said she would call me back and never did. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I called my boyfriend and told him what happened.

            "selftext": "Looking for any sort of legal/work advice about my husband\u0027s situation (he is not on Reddit, but knows I am posting this). We are happy to answer any questions. Thank you in advance.\u00A0\n\nMy husband has worked for a company for 20 years. He has been a supervisor for the past 12 years. Last week he, and all other\u00A0(16 total) supervisors, received a verbal warning (a blanket statement to all). This week, he, and at least 5 other supervisors (that he knows of), received a formal written warning,\u00A0which begins: *this is a formal written warning that your performance must be corrected and improved immediately as a condition of your continued employment.* The warning asks that he sign the bottom to acknowledge his receipt of the warning. He has the option to respond to the warning in writing (which I think he should do), or not sign (which some fellow supervisors have expressed they plan to do).\u00A0\n\nThe warning claims that he has been (this is paraphrased)...*underperforming with QR Code scanning....improvement in underperforming areas is expected...stores are considered not serviced when the QR code is not scanned, this results in a loss of sales for the company....it is necessary to see immediate improvement in your area...warning is issued to you because there was no improvement in the number of non-serviced stores from last week. The percentage represents the increase over the previous week\u2019s numbers. Your increase was at 50%.*\n\nThis is the only data he was provided with in the warning. No information about number of stores, location of stores, or if these were the same store \u0022not serviced\u0022 last week. No acknowledgement of whether or not stores even received delivery of merchandise to be sold (supervisors claim delivery issues are a significant component of this problem).\u00A0\n\nThe warning continues (again, paraphrased)...*demonstrate immediate and sustained improvement in order to retain your position...specifically includes performing in a manner that is consistent with company\u0027s direction and correcting the problem...you must demonstrate satisfactory performance and attitude in all other aspects of your position and responsibility.*\n\n*\\[BOSS\\] will be available to assist if you need specific guidance, but the responsibility for making the performance improvements rests with you. If you fail to achieve the necessary immediate and sustained improvement, there will be further disciplinary action up to and including termination.*\n\nThat is the majority of the written warning sent to my husband.\u00A0\n\nOther things to know:\n\n* The QR codes are scanned by the merchandisers he supervises.\n* They have been doing these QR codes for about six months.\n* Most of the supervisors\u0027 service percentages are in the low 90\u0027s, or higher, over the last few weeks. The company used to share the exact percentages with supervisors, but they stopped sharing them this week.\u00A0\n* Just because a QR code isn\u0027t scanned, doesn\u0027t mean the store is not serviced (otherwise the stores would be contacting the company nonstop).\u00A0\n* Again, this is the first warning that he, and several other supervisors, have ever received in all their years working for this company. A couple of the supervisors who received\u00A0the warning have been doing this for 30 years!\n\nSpecific questions (again, thank you for taking the time to read and answer our questions):\n\n1. WTF do you think is going on here?\n2. How, specifically, should he respond to this memo, if at all?\n3. It feels like they have already decided they are going to terminate people, what, if anything, can my husband do to prepare and/or protect himself? I am wondering about wrongful termination or severance. (Obviously, he is going to start looking for a new job.)\u00A0\n\nThank you again for reading and commenting.\n\n  \nEDIT TO ADD MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE QR CODES:\n\nSometimes the QR codes are not present with the merchandise delivery to the store. Sometimes they are torn off of the delivery in transit. Sometimes merchandise is delivered to the wrong store, so the QR code is scanned but gets \u0022credited as service\u0022 to a different store. Sometimes deliveries are switched from the company\u0027s drivers to a private company and QR codes did not make the switch. Company has refused to put the QR codes on the invoice with the delivery to avoid some of these issues. \n\nThe QR codes DO NOT affect the company\u0027s pay. The merchandise is \u0022pay on scan\u0022 or \u0022scan based.\u0022",

We are happy to answer any questions. Thank you in advance.\u00A0\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;My husband has worked for a company for 20 years. He has been a supervisor for the past 12 years. Last week he, and all other\u00A0(16 total) supervisors, received a verbal warning (a blanket statement to all). This week, he, and at least 5 other supervisors (that he knows of), received a formal written warning,\u00A0which begins: \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;this is a formal written warning that your performance must be corrected and improved immediately as a condition of your continued employment.\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; The warning asks that he sign the bottom to acknowledge his receipt of the warning. He has the option to respond to the warning in writing (which I think he should do), or not sign (which some fellow supervisors have expressed they plan to do).\u00A0\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The warning claims that he has been (this is paraphrased)...\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;underperforming with QR Code scanning....improvement in underperforming areas is expected...stores are considered not serviced when the QR code is not scanned, this results in a loss of sales for the company....it is necessary to see immediate improvement in your area...warning is issued to you because there was no improvement in the number of non-serviced stores from last week. The percentage represents the increase over the previous week\u2019s numbers. Your increase was at 50%.\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This is the only data he was provided with in the warning. No information about number of stores, location of stores, or if these were the same store \u0026amp;quot;not serviced\u0026amp;quot; last week. No acknowledgement of whether or not stores even received delivery of merchandise to be sold (supervisors claim delivery issues are a significant component of this problem).\u00A0\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The warning continues (again, paraphrased)...\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;demonstrate immediate and sustained improvement in order to retain your position...specifically includes performing in a manner that is consistent with company\u0026amp;#39;s direction and correcting the problem...you must demonstrate satisfactory performance and attitude in all other aspects of your position and responsibility.\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;[BOSS] will be available to assist if you need specific guidance, but the responsibility for making the performance improvements rests with you. If you fail to achieve the necessary immediate and sustained improvement, there will be further disciplinary action up to and including termination.\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;That is the majority of the written warning sent to my husband.\u00A0\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Other things to know:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;The QR codes are scanned by the merchandisers he supervises.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;They have been doing these QR codes for about six months.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Most of the supervisors\u0026amp;#39; service percentages are in the low 90\u0026amp;#39;s, or higher, over the last few weeks. The company used to share the exact percentages with supervisors, but they stopped sharing them this week.\u00A0\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Just because a QR code isn\u0026amp;#39;t scanned, doesn\u0026amp;#39;t mean the store is not serviced (otherwise the stores would be contacting the company nonstop).\u00A0\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Again, this is the first warning that he, and several other supervisors, have ever received in all their years working for this company. A couple of the supervisors who received\u00A0the warning have been doing this for 30 years!\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Specific questions (again, thank you for taking the time to read and answer our questions):\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ol\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;WTF do you think is going on here?\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;How, specifically, should he respond to this memo, if at all?\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;It feels like they have already decided they are going to terminate people, what, if anything, can my husband do to prepare and/or protect himself? I am wondering about wrongful termination or severance. (Obviously, he is going to start looking for a new job.)\u00A0\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ol\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Thank you again for reading and commenting.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;EDIT TO ADD MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE QR CODES:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Sometimes the QR codes are not present with the merchandise delivery to the store. Sometimes they are torn off of the delivery in transit. Sometimes merchandise is delivered to the wrong store, so the QR code is scanned but gets \u0026amp;quot;credited as service\u0026amp;quot; to a different store. Sometimes deliveries are switched from the company\u0026amp;#39;s drivers to a private company and QR codes did not make the switch. Company has refused to put the QR codes on the invoice with the delivery to avoid some of these issues. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The QR codes DO NOT affect the company\u0026amp;#39;s pay. The merchandise is \u0026amp;quot;pay on scan\u0026amp;quot; or \u0026amp;quot;scan based.\u0026amp;quot;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

They have a lot of stalls of people who pay for their spot and have all the their legal requirements to be involved in the market. It\u2019s run by volunteers so the money made off the market stall holders goes towards the towns funds. \n\nA local business near to where the market is held has put their own stall out (on their land) and advertised as part of the market. They have not spoken to the organisers, don\u2019t have a contract and have not payed to be any part of this market. \nIs there anything illegal about this or can be done to stop it? \nWith it being their own land I can\u2019t see how they are doing anything wrong apart from the advertising side. And just morally wrong with trying to get it for free instead of paying for there spot. \n\nThank you in advance for help and advice. ",

So there is a market that happens at the end of every month in my town, and that has been organised, done by the book and everything. They have a lot of stalls of people who pay for their spot and have all the their legal requirements to be involved in the market. It\u2019s run by volunteers so the money made off the market stall holders goes towards the towns funds. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A local business near to where the market is held has put their own stall out (on their land) and advertised as part of the market. They have not spoken to the organisers, don\u2019t have a contract and have not payed to be any part of this market. \nIs there anything illegal about this or can be done to stop it? \nWith it being their own land I can\u2019t see how they are doing anything wrong apart from the advertising side. And just morally wrong with trying to get it for free instead of paying for there spot. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Thank you in advance for help and advice. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

The new owner is honoring my lease (until May), but they are doing extensive renovations and construction. The property is a duplex, so they are doing major work on the other side which is currently vacant.

Things I have hanging on the wall fall down constantly because of the pounding. I have asked my landlord if the noise can stop after a certain time, he said he would tell the crew to be wrapped up by 5 moving forward (I have this all in writing).

I asked my landlord again and he said they shouldn\u0027t be on my side after 6, but that has not been the case. They also have taken off my mailbox and disconnected my porch light.

We ended up getting married and filing for a greencard at that point. Soon after, as a part of the greencard process, he asked to be added to my credit cards and access my bank info and I obliged. After we filed for the greencard, he asked to file our taxes jointly. I didn\u2019t want to but after some pressure we did. After 4 months of him telling me we hadn\u2019t received the tax return yet I began asking for the filing paperwork. At this point he has racked up my credit card roughly 5k, owed me 1.4k in things he said he would pay me back for, and I was still waiting for my tax return of 1.25k. He never asked me for permission to use my credit card as his main source of payment he just began using it. I kept asking about the tax return for 3 more months and he kept saying he would do it later. 7 months after we filed, I found out he had taken the entire tax return and lied to me about it for over 6 months. I am filing for a divorce now but desperately need to pay off the credit cards he racked up as they\u2019ve gone months without a payment and will no doubt go to collections soon. What can I do to make him pay me and can I get him deported for this? Thank you.",

We ended up getting married and filing for a greencard at that point. Soon after, as a part of the greencard process, he asked to be added to my credit cards and access my bank info and I obliged. After we filed for the greencard, he asked to file our taxes jointly. I didn\u2019t want to but after some pressure we did. After 4 months of him telling me we hadn\u2019t received the tax return yet I began asking for the filing paperwork. At this point he has racked up my credit card roughly 5k, owed me 1.4k in things he said he would pay me back for, and I was still waiting for my tax return of 1.25k. He never asked me for permission to use my credit card as his main source of payment he just began using it. I kept asking about the tax return for 3 more months and he kept saying he would do it later. 7 months after we filed, I found out he had taken the entire tax return and lied to me about it for over 6 months. I am filing for a divorce now but desperately need to pay off the credit cards he racked up as they\u2019ve gone months without a payment and will no doubt go to collections soon. What can I do to make him pay me and can I get him deported for this? Thank you.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

It was on theme park property, where i work, so i was able to work with security to see the camera footage of the accident, a cop did a report on the car and saw  the footage and said i was not at fault. The footage also does show the license of the vehicle that hit me however the theme park can only release that footage if i have an attorney/lawyer. i have minor damage externally to the car (dents, bumps \u0026amp; scratches) however haven\u2019t checked for any internal damage yet. I did go by an urgent care and was diagnosed whiplash and have to do x-rays on monday to confirm nothing is dislocated. I am leaning towards pressing charges/suing, however orlando police told me, in order to press charges, i have to pick out the driver in a line up, if i fail then the case drops. I have talked to my car insurance and they told me to call the other person\u2019s insurance and talk with them however not sure if it\u2019s better for me to consult with a lawyer/attorney first then talk to their insurance\u2026 is minor car damage, whiplash and a hit and run case enough for an attorney to even pick up my case? or am i better off just letting my car insurance handle it?

However my LL is attempting to rent my apartment at a price of $200 more than our most recent lease agreement.  No one is interested as the apartment is overpriced. \n\nThe cherry on top is they had us sign a surrender agreement which may forfeit any ability we have to take legal action against LL as they try to charge us, but did not search for a new tenant in good faith (according to NY law, a rental price equivalent to our lease)\n\nThey are expecting us to pay rent on this apartment on the 1st. Appreciate any advice. \n\n\n\u201CIn any lease or rental\nagreement, excluding any real estate purchase contract defined in\nparagraphs (a), (c) and (d) of subdivision four of section four hundred\nsixty-one of this chapter, covering premises occupied for dwelling\npurposes, if a tenant vacates a premises in violation of the terms of\nthe lease, the landlord shall, in good faith and according to the\nlandlord\u0027s resources and abilities, take reasonable and customary\nactions to rent the premises at fair market value or at the rate agreed\nto during the term of the tenancy, whichever is lower. \u201C\n\nSURRENDER AGREEMENT:\n\nWHEREAS, the term of the Lease for the Apartment is due to end on the 30th\nday of June, 2025 (hereinafter the \u201CTermination Date\u201D);\nWHEREAS, Tenant is desirous of being relieved of Tenant\u2019s covenants and\nobligations under the Lease and is further desirous of surrendering any and all rights, title and\ninterest Tenant may have to possession of the Apartment as of the 15th day of October, 2024\nthe Vacate Date and has requested Owner to allow Tenant to surrender the lease and Apartment\nto Owner, (hereinafter referred to as the \u201CVacate Date\u201D), and\nWHEREAS, Tenant acknowledges that Tenant is aware that Tenant may seek the\nadvice of an attorney regarding this Agreement and has elected not to do so; and\nWHEREAS, Tenant contacted Owner requesting that Owner accept the early\ntermination of the Lease in consideration of the terms and conditions specified below.\nWHEREAS, Tenant acknowledges that based on Tenant\u2019s unilateral action of\nterminating the Lease on the Vacate Date, Owner, in addition to other remedies, is entitled to\nhold the Tenant liable for rent and added rent for the unexpired term of the Lease, and for any\ndamages which may be due or sustained by Owner and all reasonable costs, fees and expenses\nincluding, but not limited to, attorney\u2019s fees, costs and expenses incurred by Owner in enforcing\nits remedies, or in renting the Apartment to others from time to time, and any additional\ndamages which Owner may be able to prove and be entitled to recover under applicable law;\nand\nWHEREAS, Owner is desirous of accommodating the Tenant\u2019s request to\nterminate the Lease on the Vacate Date, and to be relieved of Tenant\u2019s covenants and\nobligations under the terms of the Lease and to surrender any and all rights, title and interest\nhe may have to possession of the Apartment as of the Vacate Date; and\nWHEREAS, Owner is desirous of permitting Tenant and his occupants\nand/or subtenants, if any, to vacate the Apartment on the Vacate Date;\nNOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, and the\nterms and conditions contained herein, Owner and Tenant agree as follows:\n1.

I couldn\u0027t return to the U.S. because my real documents, like my passport and Social Security number, were hidden from me and used by maternal family with my mother\u2019s consent. My mother is a Mexican citizen, lawyer and former politician in Mexico, who is applying for a green card by marrying a U.S. citizen who has connections to a narco cartel in Mexico. She is now living in the U.S. awaiting her green card approval.\n\nI am stuck in Mexico, living under a fake identity, all my education and work experience are based on this false identity. They are planning to adopt my children against my will once my mother gains her residency in the U.S. They claim this might be the only way for my children to become US citizens at some point. Im willing to sacrifice myself and never go back to the U.S. since my child can\u0027t apply for a U.S. citizenship because they are registered under my fake name. My mother has been abusive all my life and she even tried to get me to sign a notarized document to help with my legal situation, using her position as a lawyer. What are the implications of this situation, and what can I do? \n\nEdit: Last year I was able to have access to my birth certificate and my passport as a child and was able to obtain a new passport at a US consulate in Mexico so I can legally enter the U.S now. My problem is that I can\u0027t bring my children with me to the U.S. and my whole life has been created around this fake identity. Using a fake identity in Mexico is a felony and can get you jail time.\n\nEdit2: My aunt worked at a US consulate in Mexico, they helped my mother get me a fake tourist visa as well, the people at this consulate knew me very well but they still helped because they were afraid to say something according to my aunt and wanted to mind their own business. \n\nI will do my best to provide as much information as I can. This topic is quite sensitive for me, and while it may seem like a minor legal issue, it brings me to tears whenever I discuss it. It has also contributed to my struggle with generalized anxiety disorder. Thank you for understanding.",

Most recently, I am helping my Mom with cancer so I rented it out (not at a profit I might add) this girl is paying what I paid in 2011 and it is an unbelievable deal. \n\nNever once in 14 years was it a problem, I have always has incredible subtenants and the owners never knew because they are quiet and no one even notices I am not there.\n\nWell the jig is up. This girl subletted this fall, threw a party with over 10 people, drunk people in hallway, when the super knocked on door she told them she was a subletter. Just a complete careless idiot. \n\nThey freaked out and broke my lease, posted a \u201C3 Day Notice to Vacate\u201D telling me my lease was invalid for subletting and told me if she doesn\u2019t leave they are starting the eviction process against me. \n\nI am 100% cooperating with them, I\u2019m willing to give up the apartment, I\u2019m not fighting them on it and I am working with them to get her out.\n\nShe has since ghosted me so I have zero communication with her. She wants to stay. I have very little sympathy for her because of the party she threw. She is raised in LA and has a ton of family here, her Mother is in the valley so she has a place to go. \n\nI told her I would return her deposit if she follows their vacate orders, pay her the remaining amount left of the month, I think it is a couple hundred dollars. \n\nMy sublease with her states, \u201C10. Hold Harmless and Indemnity \u2014 The Tenant agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Renter,_____, from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees) arising out of or in connection with the Tenant\u2019s use and occupancy of the property, including but not limited to any injury or damage to the Tenant\u0027s personal possessions.\u201D\n\nSo I am hoping I am protected against her even though she is throwing a lot of legal jargon around about her rights after she first found out they ordered her to leave. She stopped talking to me after that.\n\nMy lease with her also states, \u201C12. Termination \u2014  This Agreement may be terminated by either party with 30 days written notice. If the Tenant terminates the Agreement before the end of the 12-month term without such notice, they may forfeit the security deposit and be liable for the remaining rent due under this Agreement.\u201D\n\nI have written a letter to end the lease with 30 days written notice for her throwing the party and breaking noise ordinance rules in the building. \n\nShe continues to ghost me and is 100% silent. I just want her out so I can turn the apartment back over to the landlords and not have an eviction on my record. \n\nLuckily there is nothing in the apartment I care about so I am willing to walk away, leave all the furniture etc, I would just let it be the landlord\u2019s problem but because of the lease my name would be on the eviction notice too and I don\u2019t want that on my record.\n\nAdvice? Guidance? Etc \n\nYes. I regret subletting and realize now that was a mistake. I was lucky with the past peolle and that this didn\u2019t happen sooner than it did. How f*cked over am I? Is this girl never going to leave and I\u2019m going to get sued for eviction and be responsible? I am NOT paying her cash to leave. \n\nTIA!",

I was lucky with the past peolle and that this didn\u2019t happen sooner than it did. How f*cked over am I? Is this girl never going to leave and I\u2019m going to get sued for eviction and be responsible? I am NOT paying her cash to leave. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;TIA!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

My mother-in-law has been trying to take custody of my daughter, resorting to various legal tactics and false allegations against me. She has accused me of demanding dowry, being an incompatible husband, a neglectful father, and even harassing her, my late wife, and my wife\u0027s sister. Thankfully, the court will find these accusations to be baseless. However, they have granted her the right to visit and spend time with my daughter once a week.\n\nSince then, my mother-in-law\u0027s visits will be unbearable. It\u2019s clear that she wants to take custody of my daughter and demand financial support from me. Whenever she visits, she criticizes my parenting, claims I\u2019m not taking proper care of my daughter, and creates a hostile environment for my family and me. My concern is that she will continue using these visits as an opportunity to build a case against me, alleging that I\u0027m incapable of caring for my child.\n\nFor example, I fear that she might intentionally feed my daughter something that makes her ill, then accuse me of negligence. In the past, when my wife passed away, she filed false complaints against me, alleging that I was present when my wife died, even though she passed away in the hospital while I wasn\u2019t there. When that accusation didn\u2019t hold up, she claimed I had poisoned my wife. After the post-mortem cleared me of any wrongdoing, she still didn\u0027t stop her baseless accusations.\n\nI\u2019m also worried about what might happen once my daughter is old enough to speak. I fear my mother-in-law will manipulate her into saying she doesn\u2019t want to live with me or that I\u2019m abusive. It sounds far-fetched, but I\u2019ve seen her turn people against me before, including some of my childhood friends. She managed to persuade them that I was a bad person despite all the allegations being dismissed in court. I don\u2019t want her to succeed in doing the same with my daughter.\n\n**I Tried**\n\n1. **Moving Away**: I\u0027ve already tried relocating, but the damage to my reputation is done. In the area where I used to live, everyone believes her stories. Her influence has left a lasting impact.\n2. **Changing Contact Information and Location**: I tried to disappear, but the court issued a warrant to locate me and my daughter when she falsely claimed I had either killed or sold my child. I had to appear in court and prove my daughter was with me. Afterward, the court granted my mother-in-law visitation rights once a week.\n\n**Looking for Advice**\n\nI\u2019m in desperate need of guidance on how to protect my family, maintain custody of my daughter, and avoid falling victim to more false accusations. If anyone has dealt with a similar situation or has any practical suggestions, please share. I\u2019m trying to find a way to navigate this mess for the sake of my daughter and our future.\n\nLocation : Mumbai, Maharashtra India (Indian judiciary)",

It was a rear end collision there was little damage to my truck and the car I collided with didn\u2019t look too badly damaged either though I am aware that damage can be worse than it might look.\n\nOnce I realised later that my insurance had lapsed i got in touch with the driver to notify her and I told her that I will do whatever I can to pay for the damage. She was ok with that but said she would consider what options she has and get back in touch.\n\nSeveral months went by and I heard nothing, I have now just received a letter from the girl to say that she has some estimates for the damage to her car.

I know I have to talk to a lawyer but wanted to see what other people have gone through or if there\u2019s something to feel like spending this much money will be worth it in the long run or if I can do something about our living situation now. \n\nEdit- I\u2019ve also been in my current job longer (4 years vs her 2) if that matters",

She presented herself as 18 on the app, then asked me for my number, at which point she sent me nudes. After a few texts she lets out that she\u2019s actually 17, at which point I immediately shut the situation down. Now, I\u2019ve gotten a text and calls from a number with the same area code (but a different one from where they claim to live) claiming to be her father, that he took her phone, I need to apologize or he\u2019s going to press charges etc\u2026 \n\n I spoke with the man on the phone which basically just came down to him saying he\u2019ll see me in court. He\u2019s claiming the daughter is in the hospital after \u201Cattempting suicide because he (the father I guess) caught her making a video\u201D (that I under no circumstances asked for nor wished to receive)\n\nI guess I\u2019m just looking to see how screwed I am, if this is even legit, and what my next steps should be.  I\u2019ve already deleted our texts, her number, and the app. None of this was my intention and I\u2019m worried I\u2019m about to have my life ruined over someone\u2019s random daughter being an idiot.\n\nEdit: what has me worried is they haven\u2019t asked for money.",

She presented herself as 18 on the app, then asked me for my number, at which point she sent me nudes. After a few texts she lets out that she\u2019s actually 17, at which point I immediately shut the situation down. Now, I\u2019ve gotten a text and calls from a number with the same area code (but a different one from where they claim to live) claiming to be her father, that he took her phone, I need to apologize or he\u2019s going to press charges etc\u2026 \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I spoke with the man on the phone which basically just came down to him saying he\u2019ll see me in court. He\u2019s claiming the daughter is in the hospital after \u201Cattempting suicide because he (the father I guess) caught her making a video\u201D (that I under no circumstances asked for nor wished to receive)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I guess I\u2019m just looking to see how screwed I am, if this is even legit, and what my next steps should be.  I\u2019ve already deleted our texts, her number, and the app. None of this was my intention and I\u2019m worried I\u2019m about to have my life ruined over someone\u2019s random daughter being an idiot.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Edit: what has me worried is they haven\u2019t asked for money.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

Very long time friend of mine has been exploring the idea of becoming a tattoo artist, but it\u0027s a pretty steep cost of entry.  Just renting out studio space could be upwards of 3-4k a month (located in WA), and for a first time venture where customer volume and business may be slow to develop, it\u0027s definitely a big barrier.  But he\u0027s an incredibly talented artist, I\u0027ve known him and his family my whole life and firmly believe if he has a bit of ramp up time he could make this a great opportunity.  \n\nI currently own a house and have an unused but finished basement.  We were chatting while he and his cousin were helping with some plumbing issues, and I floated the idea of using my basement as a studio while he grows his portfolio and clients.  He is going to do more research on his end and we\u0027re planning to chat again in week or so, but I wanted to ask people here if there are serious issues with this, mostly from the perspective of my own liability if the plan is that he creates an LLC and registers my house as the address?  Will I have to check if my home owners insurance allows it / will I need any additional coverage?  I\u0027m definitely no expert in law or business, more ignorant than not.  I understand no matter what I\u0027m taking on some potential risk offering this, but I\u0027ve known the dude since kindergarten and I really would love the chance to support him in his endeavors within reason.  Appreciate the time reading this and any thoughts on the matter / advice on things I will need to consider or do, thank you!",

Ever since I started, most of the teams in the building have been compressed shifts (7 work days in a 2 week period for 12 hour days) and the business was run 24/7.\n\nTwo weeks ago they announced that they have decided they are forcing a shift change to 4/10s for day shift and 5/8s for nights. This will end up cutting an average of $10k/yr worth of pay per employee due to a change of differential pay for night shift and a loss of scheduled OT for both days and nights. This would be a total of roughly $1.5mil in pay loss for employees at my plant total. This change is affecting 60-75% of the work force.\n\nThe night of the announcement there were some light protests due to lack of moral and then some threats to fire were made the next day of it continued. \n\nFrom what I can tell this is a \u0022legal but corporately evil\u0022 type situation but I just want to verify this is legal. \n\nAlso, as an employee, is there anything I can do to stop it outside of unionizing and striking or just finding a different job?\n\nWe don\u0027t have enough support for a union due to not 100% of the staff being affected and a lot of people are too scared to lose their job/income to chance doing a strike. I like where I work (both what I do and my teams), just dislike the culture management tends to create here and don\u0027t want to leave if I can prevent it but it\u0027s seeming like that\u0027s really my only choice.",

Ever since I started, most of the teams in the building have been compressed shifts (7 work days in a 2 week period for 12 hour days) and the business was run 24/7.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Two weeks ago they announced that they have decided they are forcing a shift change to 4/10s for day shift and 5/8s for nights. This will end up cutting an average of $10k/yr worth of pay per employee due to a change of differential pay for night shift and a loss of scheduled OT for both days and nights. This would be a total of roughly $1.5mil in pay loss for employees at my plant total. This change is affecting 60-75% of the work force.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The night of the announcement there were some light protests due to lack of moral and then some threats to fire were made the next day of it continued. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;From what I can tell this is a \u0026amp;quot;legal but corporately evil\u0026amp;quot; type situation but I just want to verify this is legal. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Also, as an employee, is there anything I can do to stop it outside of unionizing and striking or just finding a different job?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We don\u0026amp;#39;t have enough support for a union due to not 100% of the staff being affected and a lot of people are too scared to lose their job/income to chance doing a strike.

She comes from a wealthy family but struggles with addiction...long story short I would pay her 3/4 of our total rent amount and she in turn would pay our landlord who resided out of the country.  We looked at the place together, moved in together, but the lease was solely in her name. It was a large house and the owner rented out the opposite wing to another person. \n  Fast forward 8 months after moving in and I woke up one morning to find my phone, wallet, and truck gone.  I was able to use a tablet around the house to contact her, and her reply was a photo of my truck parked in an unknown location next to her vehicle with a caption of \u0022be a good mouse and you\u0027ll get the cookie\u0022.  I demanded that she return my belongings immediately, and she reassured me she would.  I know I should have contacted the police right then, but she was on probation and at the time and told myself she looked at it more as her pulling a prank on me or something .  The next morning I woke up to find she had snuck in, and my walket and phone had been returned but my truck wasn\u0027t there. \n  I called her and she informed me that she was trying to get it back to the house but was suddenly stricken with COVID and quarantined at her parents house.  She would not disclose the location of my vehicle and that was the only contact I had with her for about 24hrs.   \n  At that point I decided to fight fire with fire, enlisted the help of a friend, and relocated a few of her higher value items and some illegal possessions of hers.  Then I let her know I was open to an exchange, and she agreed to meet me at home later that night. (I know I know I know, I should have called the police).   I ended up falling asleep waiting on her to show, and woke up to her finally arriving in the am.  She had not brought my vehicle back... She did however tell the new roommate who had moved a few weeks prior and I had little interaction with, that we had broken up and that I was there against her wishes, that I had been relieved of my key but broke back in.  \n  I informed them both that I would be happy to leave once I had my vehicle returned so I could do so.  Now with an audience she began to state that I was making up the story about her taking the truck.  This caused the roomate to brandish a screwdriver like a knife as he attempted to get me out of the house.  \n  Not wanting anyone to get hurt or legal trouble of my own I let them have the victory and walked down the driveway and called 911 once I hit the street.  I informed the operator that my girlfriend had taken my vehicle without permission and had just been forced off the property it was taken from under the threat of being stabbed.  The operator suggested I get away from the house for safety and I could meet deputies down the road.  \n  At the next cross street I turned and attempted to walk off the adrenaline.  Unfortunately during that short period of time my cellphone battery died, and the deputies had gone directly to the house. \n  Eventually I turned around and started walking back towards the house, and was intercepted by an agressive deputy.  I was immediately detained and when another unit arrived to our location I was asked what was going on.  I explained that we had  agreed to meet at the house the night prior, I fell asleep, and was ran off in the morning.     It was at that point I was placed under arrest.  They had been told by the other people involved that there was no truck, I didn\u0027t live at the house, and all of this was a stalker scenario.  I was not given a chance to charge my phone which would have proven my story... I was charged with 1st degree Burglary and 3rd degree stalking.  Po\n  Due to the nature of the charges my bond was set rather high, and I had no family in the state able to put up property.  I was given a court appointed lawyer who might as well had a district attorneys badge on his belt.  I sat in jail, classified with the murderers and such for 5 months without an indictment waiting for my first court date, which only took place when I filed my own Writ of Habeas Corpus. And as I waited to finally see the judge, my piece of shit court appointed attorney tried to convince me that she would not rule in my favor \nand that his advice was to accept a plea deal of 2yrs in lieu of the hearing on my writ. . . The judge  granted personal recognizance on the charges as was legally required (this would have been an automatic thing at the 90th day of being held without being indicted by a grand jury, however the governor had signed an emergency order overriding that safety net out of fear that violent criminals would be on the streets of a grand jury could not be held due to COVID restrictions.  Over a year later, with a new attorney the charges were dismissed. \n  Upon my release I did a vin search on my Expedition and found out that it had been in an accident (thankfully the person driving itinsured it in his name).  I was able to get all his details from the accident report and made contact with him.  He informed me that she had sold him the truck for a $400 down payment and that he was told the title would be cleared up down the line because the owner was in jail.  He was livid with the whole situation and is living proof that she had stolen my truck, and sold it... Then lied to police so I would go to jail instead of her.\n  There was a no contact order in place when I was released... The moment it expired I confronted her while secretly recording audio / video (Texas is a one party state)  At one point I plea to her to understand what it was like to lose 6 months of your life locked away and labeled a crazy stalker... She responded with stating on camera that all of this happened because I chose to involve the police and she didn\u0027t care what happens to a snitch.  \n  My life will never be the same... Meanwhile there were no consequences for her... my court appointed attorney actually got paid for trying to scare  me into pleading on charges he knew i was innocent of...And the officers that treated me like a piece of shit, called me a disgrace to fellow veterans and would not even take 2 mins to let me charge my phone and prove my side of the story probably bragged about getting me off the street.  \n  Do I have any recourse?",
