He said \u201CHey!! Would but I\u2019m gonna be busy tomorrow with work and school!\u201D Then he texted me about something I barely posted about on IG (it was the last pic in a 10 photo post and he doesn\u2019t even have instagram\u2026)\n- I texted him two days ago again because I unexpectedly was back in the city. No answer. \n\nTHEN yesterday, I made the bold decision to just go to the cafe where he works, no warning. I wasn\u2019t sure if he was working but turned out he was. \n\nI brought a book and did a lot of reading but we also chatted a decent amount. Then I left because the cafe was closing, and I was like okay whatever, not happening, chapter closed. But like 3 minutes after I walked out, he texted me saying how hot I looked. \n\nWe texted a bit last night. He seems into it, like he even thanked me for just showing up at his work, but I honestly cannot tell. My text responses are definitely longer than his. The last text I sent him last night was pretty bold for me, and I straight up said that I was into him. He didn\u0027t answer but I knew he was busy last night and early this morning.\n\nI sent another text this morning following up on something we\u0027d talked about yesterday and received a pretty lukewarm response. And then nothing else when I wrote back. Now, I\u0027m back out of the city he lives in. \n\nAnyone have any words of wisdom? Does he want me to keep talking to him? Should I just let him go? How do I get him to be more responsive? (I\u0027m very aware that I can\u0027t change a guy and not trying to) ",

Having some issues, could do with some advice, me and my bf have been together 5yrs we have a child we live all together, I feel like he always wants to do stuff with his friends and doesn\u2019t prioritise our relationship at all of me, first example I was talking about a bar I wanted to try for months (we don\u2019t get out a lot due to being parents) he always said \u201CI will take you but don\u2019t have the money at the moment\u201D which is completely fine however I do pay my way always I work full time go half\u2019s on the bills and pay for my own car and personal finances, however I didn\u2019t want to push him if he isn\u2019t financially stable however he then went to this bar with his friends? I was angry he knows I\u2019ve wanted to go but goes with his friends instead? We argued he said I was jealous and don\u2019t want him to have a social life and said I\u2019m obsessed with his friends, however he always does stuff with them, they come round the house too see him nearly every other night, he plays computer with them all the time so I just feel really angry when that gets said.\nNow this weekend has really been the cherry on top for me and I don\u2019t even know what to think anymore, we haven\u2019t ever been on a family holiday he urged us to get our passports and said he wanted to take us away as a family which may I add I offered and said I WILL put whatever I can to the holiday, he then told me \u201Csorry I haven\u2019t got the money to take us all away until next year\u201D I said that\u2019s fine I understand, few days later drops it on me he\u2019s going Amsterdam with his friends for the weekend? I was confused, we had a argument about it and once again it was \u201Cyou\u2019re jealous\u201D \u201Cguess what I\u2019m going on holiday and you\u2019re not\u201D just spiteful stuff I\u2019ve pulled him up about before, he then a few days later tells me he feels bad and says he wants to take us to a fancy meal, since we don\u2019t go out a lot I said yes okay, but I was still angry! The hotel and flight cost him \u00A3300 he took \u00A3400 spending money and brought new clothes for \u00A3200 that\u2019s 1,000 which could have been put down for a family holiday; do I sound unfair to be upset? I wanted us to experience things together for the first time but it don\u2019t seem that way with him, me and our child are stuck at home while he\u2019s away while we haven\u2019t experienced that yet, he manipulates the situation when I speak about it and makes me feel selfish for thinking this way, his friends have no respect either, he let them park all outside my house blocking the foot path and the neighbours have been at my door shouting at me threatening to call the police, I really don\u2019t need the stress he knows this as I deal with a lot as it is including a child with special needs and working full time! I called him and told him and I was accused of trying to ruin his holiday? I just don\u2019t know what to think anymore I\u2019m only 22 and always feel unworthy and miserable with him, I do have love for him but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in love anymore?

He came after 9 months and we have lived together for three months. These months passed and I also helped him by borrowing him money to help him with his financial problems(he pays me back when he can). Last week he told me that he has encountered a new financial problem and he feels very bad to borrow money from me again and he doesn\u2019t want to be a burden so he decided to move back at his parents house for a few months until he can be financially stable to contribute to rent, food etc and to also take me out. I told him that he doens\u2019t need to move and that he can stay here, I offered to keep helping him with money until he gets back on his feet but he still decided to leave. I admit that I told him in the past that I don\u2019t feel very comfortable to lend him that much money but I still did it every time. Of course the night he decided to leave we had a big fight, I begged him to stay but he told me that he is only causing me problems and that this is the best decision for both of us even if I don\u2019t see it. In my anger I checked his phone and I saw some messages from his parents that said that they are waiting for him at home and they can pick him up that night and also that they will go through this together. This upset me even more because I believe that we should go through this together not with his parents. I told him this and then he told me that I don\u2019t trust him, he got very upset and he told me that I made his decision easier. He told me that he will come back and that this is not different than what I did when i left in the first place for the job opportunity. Now I don\u2019t know how I feel and even if I want him to come back because he hurt me deeply. Also the timing of his departure was very inappropriate because i was going to have a big exam coming up in the next 2 weeks and also our rent was coming to an end and we needed to look for a new one, which I was left to deal with by myself. Do you think he was right to leave? I need objective opinions because I don\u2019t know what to think anymore. Thank you",

It was his bday on September so I just texted him to wish and the conversation started from there . Now the case is I am starting to like him like start having feelings for him but I don\u2019t understand anything from his side . Cuz he never texts first or yk initiates the conversation I am the one to do that like 99% of the time . But whenever we talks he talks really sweetly with me but not like situationship types just normal. We have never defined what kind of relationship we have b/w us are we friends or are we just acquaintances or there might be something for us idk \nHe is a dropper too and is currently preparing for Neet 2025 so I don\u2019t even want to trouble him with this stuff \nGuys let me know what do you think about it ????? \n\n\n",

I usually don\u0027t like confiding in strangers, but I don\u0027t have anyone else to talk to right now.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for about 7 months now. Typically, we get along well and find a common interest in gaming and TV shows, even some anime. When we argue, it\u0027s almost always over something really stupid that we both laugh about within the next hour. I know I\u0027m 18, but I consider myself a little bit more mature than my age. My boyfriend on the other hand is very goofy and has the humor of a 15 year old boy. (Can\u0027t exaggerate this enough lol.) He\u0027s also a lot more emotional than I am, which leads to now.\n\nI finally managed to land a job. He\u0027s been providing for a while, but because of the economy he needed help. I\u0027m on day 5 of working. The fact that I just started is very important.\n\nAbout a week before I started working, I noticed he seemed more agitated than normal. Little things would piss him off, I would trigger his anger just by asking him questions. At first, I assumed it was lack of sex due to me getting my wisdom teeth out not long ago. (Practically fully healed on the third day.) I didn\u0027t want to do anything because I felt like shit. He isn\u0027t a porn watcher, so it made sense in my head. I decided to talk to him and that wasn\u0027t it.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, my last day until I was off of work for the week. I asked him to be there on time, as i was really tired and he was busy. I told him I could get my grand mother to pick me up if needed, this is also very important.\n\nI was about 3 minutes late leaving work because I haven\u0027t used cash registers before (old ones) and wanted a quick run down. I walk to the truck, and when I get in he immediately blows up on me, saying \u0022You said be here on time and you were late. I\u0027m tired of this. If you\u0027re going to be late, I don\u0027t want to pick you up anymore.\u0022 (I\u0027m usually always getting out 2 or 3 minutes late.)\n\nI tried explaining, and then he cuts me off and says \u0022I left work and gave someone else part of my pay to cover me. If I knew you\u0027d be late I never would\u0027ve came.\u0022 I told him straight up that he never had to come in the first place, I had a ride and right now money\u0027s tight and we need to afford rent. I make less and can\u0027t do it on my own.\n \nHe immediately tried to apologize, but I cut him off and that only fueled his anger more. I was so angry and stressed at that point from getting off of work that I didn\u0027t even care anymore.\n\nThe rest of the drive home is constant bickering back and forth, and then he says \u0022I can\u0027t do this anymore.\u0022 So I say what? Being with me? And he says \u0022yeah. I don\u0027t think this is going to work. I don\u0027t want to talk to you right now.\u0022 I said okay, and went quiet. As soon as I stopped giving him my attention, he chimes up and asks why I\u0027m not talking. Very hypocritical (I think) of him.\n\nEventually, we get home and he says he wants to take a drive. Doesn\u0027t know where he wants to go, but he doesn\u0027t want to be around me. I told him fine, I\u0027d rather talk it out and come to a middle ground but if you feel the need to run, do it. I told him that the way he was talking to me was terrible, and his words were manipulative. If you just want to make me feel bad, then I\u0027d rather you go for a drive and cool down first.\n\nHe kept arguing but at this point I was done and went to take a shower. He never left, and when I came out he was in the bed crying. He told me he knew he was wrong, and how terrible he was. He said I\u0027d never look at him the same, and he didn\u0027t think it would work out. I let him sleep it off before we talked again, and today we seem fine.\n\nRegardless, he\u0027s been getting angrier and more explosive each day. I don\u0027t know if he\u0027s genuinely manipulative, (which I really don\u0027t think is the case, he\u0027s never said anything like that before yesterday.) Or he just has his own issues he needs to get over, like an insecurity or something.\n\nI feel worse because I\u0027ve tried to communicate about it, but he always assumes I\u0027m attacking him. I\u0027m not trying to put him on the spot, I\u0027m trying to solve an issue. Whether it\u0027s my fault, his, or nobody\u0027s. \n\nI really don\u0027t want to break up, because most of our time together is great, but I really need to find the issue and nail it in. I\u0027m hoping another perspective on this will help, and if there\u0027s any more information you need just ask.\n\nTl;dr: Boyfriend has been nothing but angry recently with no clear indication of what\u0027s making him angry.",

We were together for two years, and honestly, I thought she was the\u00A0*one*. We had plans \u2013 the big \u201CM\u201D word, you know? Marriage. Kids. A life together where we\u2019d probably buy a bunch of guinea pigs and name them after our favorite Game of Thrones characters (yeah, we\u2019re\u00A0*those*\u00A0people).\n\nAnyway, to say it ended badly would be like saying the Titanic just \u201Chit a little ice.\u201D We had this fight \u2013 the kind of fight that makes you rethink everything, from your choice of breakfast cereal that morning to your taste in people. It was explosive, people. Words were said. Tears were shed. Doors were slammed. And, finally, we ended it. For real.\n\nBut here\u2019s where things get spicy. We had this shared Google Drive with hundreds of photos from all our trips and cute moments together \u2013 think\u00A0*wholesome couple stuff*, okay? Kissing in front of waterfalls, holding hands under sunsets, feeding each other gelato in Rome. (Yeah, we were\u00A0*that*\u00A0couple.) The problem? Just looking at those photos felt like a punch to my soul. Every time I saw that little drive icon on my desktop, it was like a reminder that she was off somewhere living her best life while I was here\u2026 well,\u00A0*not*\u00A0doing that.\n\nSo, in a moment of pure, unfiltered rage (and maybe a bit of overly-dramatic flair), I decided, \u201CYou know what? Screw it!\u201D And I deleted the entire drive. Like, I didn\u2019t just remove\u00A0*my*\u00A0access. Oh no. I went full scorched earth. Every single digital memory we shared? Gone. Just like that.\n\nI didn\u2019t tell her. No heads-up, no courtesy text, nothing. Just click, delete, poof \u2013 a modern tragedy in two seconds. And honestly, I felt this weird sense of power afterward, like I was some kind of digital warrior reclaiming my life (or something equally ridiculous).\n\nOf course, about a day later, she texts me. She\u2019s all like, \u201CHey\u2026 where\u2019s the Google Drive?\u201D And I\u2019m just there, reading her message, feeling the weight of what I\u2019ve done like a rock in my stomach. But here\u2019s where it gets weird \u2013 instead of coming clean, I told her maybe it was a\u00A0*glitch*\u00A0and I\u2019d \u201Clook into it.\u201D She started freaking out, sending texts in all caps about how those photos meant so much to her and how she had no backups, and I just\u2026 panicked. I couldn\u2019t admit I had turned two years of memories into digital dust in a fit of post-breakup drama.\n\nNow my friends are divided. Some say she deserves it \u2013 after all, she\u00A0*broke my heart.*\u00A0Others say I\u2019m a total A-hole for deleting something so sentimental and not even giving her a chance to save them.\n\nSo, Reddit, do you think I\u0027m being an arsehole for deleting our shared drive of photos without telling her? And, yeah, I get it. I probably sound like the villain here, but breakups make you do crazy things, okay?",

When we met I was mildly depressed and had a toxic trait of being icked at women who were nice and way too into me. It\u2019s something I have overcome now that I\u2019m in therapy and medicated. Through texting she texted back in a curt manner and in person she seemed disinterested in me. I later found out she was nervous and wasn\u2019t good at texting. I was drawn and attracted to her standoffish manner. A few years later our relationship really developed and I made her open up by always communicating her how I feel. She has a tendency of coming off rude and selfish. There\u2019s so many examples to list that I\u2019d be here all night typing. \n\nWe had discussions about how her selfish acts make me feel and how she needs to put in effort the same way I do into this relationship. She would understand and put the work in for a few weeks and then it would fizzle. \n\nAfter getting therapy and being medicated at 28 myself, I was more understanding of A. She grew up in a household where her mom would mismanage her own money and guilt tripped A into giving her what little money A had as young as age of 12 to 24. Those also come with endless examples that I couldn\u2019t possibly list them all. \n\n\nWhile medicated, the selfishness was tolerable and didn\u2019t make me feel unappreciated and or feeling like the relationship was one sided. But a recent act happened that I haven\u2019t been able to shake off my mind. \n\n\nWe went to go see The Wild Giant and before the we left the house she was preparing herself a snack container and told me \u201CBabe make yourself a snack pack because I don\u2019t want to share mine\u201D it was a pretty reasonable request and even if it wasn\u2019t I was used to comments like that so it didn\u2019t bother me and again, medicated. I told her I\u2019ll order the hotdog combo at the theater cuz I wanted hot dogs since it was more filling. We get to the theater and the hot dogs are sold out and I wasn\u2019t in the mood for popcorn. So I just got a drink that I offered to split with her. \n\n\nDuring the movie I was expecting her to offer a bit of chips or even a single gummy bear from her Tupperware of snack but she never did. She even heard a growling from my stomach and asked if I fell asleep and I said no it\u2019s my stomach. Yes I could\u2019ve asked her and yes she probably would have given me some hesitantly. But I needed a question answered that wasn\u2019t sitting right with me. Would she unselfishly share her snack with her partner that was the track to be her life partner? She did not. \n\nThe movie was great and a 10/10 and it really hit me in the part of the heart that wants kids. Then the fear of my kids mother being selfish with them. And it hit me that I don\u2019t think I can marry this woman. My best friend. The person who I\u2019ve given 5 years of my life. \n\nFolks of Reddit who were with similar partners and ended up marrying them, did they change once married or had kids? \n\nTLDR: my girlfriend not sharing movie snacks with me makes me doubt marriage ",

But a recent act happened that I haven\u2019t been able to shake off my mind. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We went to go see The Wild Giant and before the we left the house she was preparing herself a snack container and told me \u201CBabe make yourself a snack pack because I don\u2019t want to share mine\u201D it was a pretty reasonable request and even if it wasn\u2019t I was used to comments like that so it didn\u2019t bother me and again, medicated. I told her I\u2019ll order the hotdog combo at the theater cuz I wanted hot dogs since it was more filling. We get to the theater and the hot dogs are sold out and I wasn\u2019t in the mood for popcorn. So I just got a drink that I offered to split with her. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;During the movie I was expecting her to offer a bit of chips or even a single gummy bear from her Tupperware of snack but she never did. She even heard a growling from my stomach and asked if I fell asleep and I said no it\u2019s my stomach. Yes I could\u2019ve asked her and yes she probably would have given me some hesitantly. But I needed a question answered that wasn\u2019t sitting right with me. Would she unselfishly share her snack with her partner that was the track to be her life partner? She did not. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The movie was great and a 10/10 and it really hit me in the part of the heart that wants kids. Then the fear of my kids mother being selfish with them. And it hit me that I don\u2019t think I can marry this woman. My best friend. The person who I\u2019ve given 5 years of my life. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Folks of Reddit who were with similar partners and ended up marrying them, did they change once married or had kids? \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;TLDR: my girlfriend not sharing movie snacks with me makes me doubt marriage \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

I want to be there for her at all times, but I want to have fun too and not be chained down.

And I know if I ever try to be like hey this is a lot can you please not vent without warning or when I\u0027m having fun and all that, I know she will just shut down and bawl her eyes out and not tell me anything and apologize (she apologizes 24/7 but I try to reassure her that she doesn\u0027t need to, and I talk it through with her like why do you think you need to apologize) and just.

It\u2019s been a bad relationship on and off the entire time. He\u2019s emotionally abusive and I\u2019ve heard he\u2019s been physical with an ex. I\u2019ve left a few times but it\u2019s never stuck. We have a baby together and I don\u2019t know if I won\u2019t leave because of that or what it is. I really couldn\u2019t tell you. I\u2019ve been worried lately that he\u2019s right and that I\u2019m the problem but I think about his ex wife and ex fianc\u00E9 and I feel like he\u2019s the common denominator in these bad relationships. Am I crazy for wondering if it\u2019s me? Does he have me so brainwashed that I\u2019m starting to doubt myself?

I struggle with self-love and often feel disconnected from happiness. At times, I wonder if I truly love my partner or if I\u2019ve just settled because it feels easier. I often feel so disconnected that I sense I deserve more but end up settling for less.\n\nFor example, I recently told him I was feeling down and took a rare day off from work (which I don\u2019t love, but I\u2019m unsure about my career path). I expected some support, maybe a small gift or a bit more emotional connection. Instead, I got the bare minimum\u2014he asked how I was and if I was upset with him. Even after I reassured him that I wasn\u2019t, that was pretty much it. I got some cuddles, but I wanted something more.\n\nI really want to understand my feelings better and figure out my own identity. Have any of you been in a similar situation?

I have been with her for over 2 years now and I love her a lot. She is my everything literally. But sometimes when I\u0026amp;#39;m too tired or lack energy totally, I just talk without empathy. That\u0026amp;#39;s how I would say it. But it\u0026amp;#39;s not just to her, that\u0026amp;#39;s how I usually talk to everyone when I\u0026amp;#39;m exhausted. It has hurt her a lot and I want to change to this. I still talk everything that I talk with her usually But yeah Like I said it\u0026amp;#39;s just a little bit of lack of empathy. I really do not want to hurt her at all. \nWe decided that I better not talk at all if I\u0026amp;#39;m in that mood. But I want a better solution to change myself for the better. How do I do that?\nI would really appreciate any advice from you all.\nIk what I do is wrong.\nHow can I change my attitude?\nEdit: my gf is (F21)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m being controlling; I just struggle with anxious attachment. I believe he\u2019s an avoidant but has never acted this way till recently. \n\nWhen I expressed my feelings, he said it stressed him out and that he\u2019d rather lose me than try to improve. We\u2019ve been together nearly three years, so I really want this to work. He recently made a new female friend, which makes me uncomfortable based on what he\u2019s told me and my brief meeting with her. She has a boyfriend but also sleeps around with one of his friends. Although I trust him, I asked him to keep his distance and not actively invite her out. He agreed, but it turns out he has been the one inviting her to hang out with his friend group.\n\nEvery time I try to discuss my feelings, he says he hates talking about it and doesn\u2019t want to stress. We also had established a boundary about not going clubbing before we both started uni, as he didn\u2019t want me to go. But now he\u2019s expressed a strong desire to go, which worries me since all his friends are single...\n\nI always make an effort to update him when I\u2019m out with my friends, so it\u2019s frustrating that he doesn\u2019t do the same. I\u2019ve explained that I often need reassurance, and he responds, \u201CJust trust me and you won\u2019t have to ask.\u201D It feels like efforts have become one-sided and he no longer cares about what I feel. \n\nHe was the one who begged me to try long-distance. When we first moved, he constantly expressed how much he missed me and how he saw a future with me. However, since uni started and he made new friends, his behavior has changed.

He\u2019s become less attentive and resistant to discussing our relationship, despite having previously expressed a desire to work on things. I feel frustrated and neglected, especially since he\u2019s now keen to go clubbing after we established boundaries against it.

I know we can\u0027t talk from 5AM-4PMsometimes later but when we can talk he seems so tuned out and it just breaks my heart. I love him so much and I know he loves me but I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s a good time. I\u0027ll never be in college again and I don\u0027t ever want to regret how I spent this time. I could never build up the guts to cut it off but I don\u0027t know if I should try to. He is always respectful to me though, understanding of my feelings, never once has sworn at me in the year and a half we\u0027ve been dating, doesn\u0027t yell at me, etc. he really is a great guy but I just don\u0027t feel the love and attention I once did. I know our lives are changing but is that supposed to change? I also told him I was thinking about coming home  to see him and he didn\u0027t even seem excited. I try to remember we are different people and just because I would handle it differently doesn\u0027t mean he should but it still hurts me. I also asked if he would want to be going out that weekend but I can\u0027t go to the bars with him and he was on the fence about it. But to me it\u0027s like why would you even consider going out if I\u0027m coming home and I haven\u0027t seen you in weeks. I know he\u0027s not talking to other women or anything like that, but still why wouldn\u0027t you want to be with me. If I could go out with him I would but I\u0027m not of age yet. I just don\u0027t know what to do. And whenever I tell him how I\u0027m feeling he does make efforts to fix it but I feel like there\u0027s just some disconnect. I could easily ignore it but that\u0027s just not me. Help me pls ",

I feel like he doesn\u0026amp;#39;t have a lot of time for me right now and it makes me so sad. I know we can\u0026amp;#39;t talk from 5AM-4PMsometimes later but when we can talk he seems so tuned out and it just breaks my heart. I love him so much and I know he loves me but I don\u0026amp;#39;t know if it\u0026amp;#39;s a good time. I\u0026amp;#39;ll never be in college again and I don\u0026amp;#39;t ever want to regret how I spent this time. I could never build up the guts to cut it off but I don\u0026amp;#39;t know if I should try to. He is always respectful to me though, understanding of my feelings, never once has sworn at me in the year and a half we\u0026amp;#39;ve been dating, doesn\u0026amp;#39;t yell at me, etc. he really is a great guy but I just don\u0026amp;#39;t feel the love and attention I once did. I know our lives are changing but is that supposed to change? I also told him I was thinking about coming home  to see him and he didn\u0026amp;#39;t even seem excited. I try to remember we are different people and just because I would handle it differently doesn\u0026amp;#39;t mean he should but it still hurts me. I also asked if he would want to be going out that weekend but I can\u0026amp;#39;t go to the bars with him and he was on the fence about it. But to me it\u0026amp;#39;s like why would you even consider going out if I\u0026amp;#39;m coming home and I haven\u0026amp;#39;t seen you in weeks. I know he\u0026amp;#39;s not talking to other women or anything like that, but still why wouldn\u0026amp;#39;t you want to be with me. If I could go out with him I would but I\u0026amp;#39;m not of age yet. I just don\u0026amp;#39;t know what to do. And whenever I tell him how I\u0026amp;#39;m feeling he does make efforts to fix it but I feel like there\u0026amp;#39;s just some disconnect. I could easily ignore it but that\u0026amp;#39;s just not me. Help me pls \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

He moved that date to Wednesday, that day he said he would see if he still felt up to it when he woke up. That is when i asked for space because when he drags out plans often it gets really disappointing.

It is the first time in 2 weeks that we will see each other and he has delayed it already. 30mins isn\u0027t the problem, it\u0027s the inconsistent planning when it comes to me.

In the beginning it was no apologies ever even when she was in the wrong. Then eventually she started giving apologies sometimes when she\u2019s in the wrong. Now I would say for most of the time that she\u2019s wrong she apologizes. However, she still lacks a general sense of empathy.\n\nMy main issue in our relationship is how quick I am to anger. I have gotten much better at it same as how she has gotten better at apologizing, but when we get in big arguments our progress goes out the window and emotions get in the way.\n\nNow that we have mostly resolved the argument from today we\u2019re discussing how to move on. She asked me how we do that. I answered that we need to improve for eachother on those two fronts. She began to argue that she does show a lot of empathy. I told her how she shows a lot more than she used to but still not a lot in general. \n\nHer stance is now that she doesn\u2019t need to improve on empathy any more because she shows it when she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. I explained to her that it\u2019s always important to show empathy in a relationship and she disagrees. She even said \u201CI don\u2019t believe that. I need proof\u201D. I then sent her multiple articles showing why empathy is so important in relationships even when the other may be in the wrong. She just responded and said well I don\u2019t agree with that. \n\nWhat do I do?\n\nTL;DR How do I get my girlfriend to be more empathetic when she completely disagree with the idea of it unless she is completely in the wrong?",

I keep having a discussion with my boyfriend about the fact that he is online gaming with another girl. He says it is just a friend and they like to play the same games. Most of the time they play with more people but sometimes they play alone and I am not comfortable with that. I told him that but he keeps saying that it is just playing, nothing else. When I bring it up, he also says that I am acting stupid because we have arguments about this. I am really second-guessing our relationship right now because I cannot get over it. And I think, if I feel this way and tell him, why doesn\u0026amp;#39;t he just stop? Hopefully, I can get some advice here because I really feel lost.

We are very much in love, but there are various things in our relationship that make me sometimes question what the health of our relationship could look like long term. The bigger things I could probably discuss in detail in another post, but what\u2019s on my mind today is the anxiety that I get when thinking about my boyfriend interacting with people in my life. My boyfriend is reserved, not talkative, doesn\u2019t make the best first impression, and in situations such as these I always feel like I\u2019m forcing him to go and feel like I have to pull teeth for him to open up. He only pops into his personality when he\u2019s around his friends and every once in a with he\u2019s family. (There have been multiple times at his family function where he\u2019s completely quiet the entire time or for hours and just not engaged in the conversation or vibes at all, it feels like I\u2019m the one hanging out with his family instead). Around my family he\u2019s very quiet and rarely talks, many times he just simply looks uncomfortable and ready to leave (which I\u2019ll give him credit because my family speaks mostly not English). In our 5 years of dating he has never really tried to get to know anyone in my family and this has affected his relationship with my family, which is important to me because I\u2019m a very family oriented person. He really isn\u2019t and I believe that\u2019s due to his difficult upbringing. The same is true around my friends. The few times they have come over, he has always said his respectful hellos, and moves on to do his things in other parts of the apartment completely. For the most part he has been respectful, except for some times at my family\u2019s event where he was been visibly sulking looking to go home. I have brought it up to him before that I do wish he would open up more and engage with other people in my life because I love him and it would be great if others in my life could get to know him the way I do. But, he always says something along the line of \u201Cyou know I\u2019m just reserved, I told like taking much\u201D.  Which I know and do understand. I try my best to be understanding and respect this but, I can\u2019t help myself from wanting us to spend time with others, not just me talking about him when I\u2019m around other people. Well the thing is I don\u2019t really know how to make the situation better, because I definitely feel some anxiety now about introducing him to other people in my life, but is this a me problem? Tonight we have a dinner planned with one of my friends (22F) and her husband (23M), and I\u2019m hoping that my boyfriend can open up, but I keep finding myself stressing out and finding this worry that the evening will turn akward and my boyfriend won\u2019t say anything during the dinner. Thoughts on the situation. Any clarity and different perspectives would be very appreciated! ",

The bigger things I could probably discuss in detail in another post, but what\u2019s on my mind today is the anxiety that I get when thinking about my boyfriend interacting with people in my life. My boyfriend is reserved, not talkative, doesn\u2019t make the best first impression, and in situations such as these I always feel like I\u2019m forcing him to go and feel like I have to pull teeth for him to open up. He only pops into his personality when he\u2019s around his friends and every once in a with he\u2019s family. (There have been multiple times at his family function where he\u2019s completely quiet the entire time or for hours and just not engaged in the conversation or vibes at all, it feels like I\u2019m the one hanging out with his family instead). Around my family he\u2019s very quiet and rarely talks, many times he just simply looks uncomfortable and ready to leave (which I\u2019ll give him credit because my family speaks mostly not English). In our 5 years of dating he has never really tried to get to know anyone in my family and this has affected his relationship with my family, which is important to me because I\u2019m a very family oriented person. He really isn\u2019t and I believe that\u2019s due to his difficult upbringing. The same is true around my friends. The few times they have come over, he has always said his respectful hellos, and moves on to do his things in other parts of the apartment completely. For the most part he has been respectful, except for some times at my family\u2019s event where he was been visibly sulking looking to go home. I have brought it up to him before that I do wish he would open up more and engage with other people in my life because I love him and it would be great if others in my life could get to know him the way I do. But, he always says something along the line of \u201Cyou know I\u2019m just reserved, I told like taking much\u201D.  Which I know and do understand. I try my best to be understanding and respect this but, I can\u2019t help myself from wanting us to spend time with others, not just me talking about him when I\u2019m around other people. Well the thing is I don\u2019t really know how to make the situation better, because I definitely feel some anxiety now about introducing him to other people in my life, but is this a me problem? Tonight we have a dinner planned with one of my friends (22F) and her husband (23M), and I\u2019m hoping that my boyfriend can open up, but I keep finding myself stressing out and finding this worry that the evening will turn akward and my boyfriend won\u2019t say anything during the dinner. Thoughts on the situation. Any clarity and different perspectives would be very appreciated! \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

This isn\u0027t one of those relationships where we fight all the time and it\u0027s incredibly toxic - we genuinely have it SO GOOD, it\u0027s just this one recurring issue that is so upsetting, I can\u0027t decide if it\u0027s worth leaving the relationship over.\n\nMy boyfriend has severe anxiety, and any time I have a problem with something he does, he becomes passive aggressive, and then goes into what he calls his \u0022freeze mode\u0022 afterwards. It\u0027s incredibly frustrating because it doesn\u0027t feel like we ever actually TALK THROUGH any of our problems. We kind of just wait for him to be ready to talk (sometimes he never is ready) or we just don\u0027t talk until is freeze mode is over and by that point we just forget, or sometimes I will bring up a disagreement again and then he\u0027ll just go into freeze mode again. There\u0027s no progress forward.\n\nThree weeks ago I argued with him because I feel that he fails on his commitment to recognize my needs, and doesn\u0027t always keep his promised on how he would show up in a relationship (often late when meeting me, doesn\u0027t care my seeing him results in me skipping gym or falling behind on work, doesn\u0027t make an attempt to keep my apartment clean and doesn\u0027t mind so much if I do it all alone.) I\u0027m sure he felt, and feels, bad at having this be presented to him - I\u0027m sure he doesn\u0027t mean to cause a break in my routine and make me feel like I\u0027m working alone (he simply isn\u0027t that type of man, he\u0027s not vindictive) but because I was rather brutal with my honesty, he still isn\u0027t ready to talk about it... three weeks later... he just says he \u0022resents me\u0022 and \u0022isn\u0027t ready to talk about it.\u0022\n\nTonight we were at a restaurant and I told him (casually, in my opinion) that I\u0027ve spent another day with him and \u0022I\u0027ve missed the gym today\u0022 (I was going 6 days a week before I met him, but since I\u0027ve started dating him, I hardly ever go. I didn\u0027t SAY that though, I just said I\u0027ve missed the gym today. I helped him move and didn\u0027t prioritize myself again). He immediately responded \u0022so it\u0027s my fault? Of course it\u0027s my fault.\u0022 I said to him \u0022No, I never said that. I just sometimes want you to acknowledge my priorities, and how I hardly ever meet them when I\u0027m with you. I just want you to make a suggestion on how things can change so that I can meet my needs when we\u0027re together because right now I\u0027m not, maybe you can just make a promise to go with me tomorrow or something\u0022 And he just said \u0022I don\u0027t want to talk about this now\u0022 and immediately - freeze mode. We paid the bill, went back to his place, and he hasn\u0027t said a word to me.\n\nHe\u0027s such a lovely man otherwise. It just upsets me so much - he loves me, and he wants to be with me, and he wants me to meet my needs - but God forbid we have a conversation when things don\u0027t go that way. I\u0027m really tired of feeling like a mother waiting for my kid to come out of his room when he\u0027s calmed down and ready to act grown up. I\u0027m also so sick of being the one initiating contact after a disagreement, sometimes it feels like if I\u0027m not the first one to say something, we may never talk again.\n\nWhat\u0027s more is that I really want to be with a man who can put me at ease when problems arise, and make me feel safe. But he\u0027s completely emotionally unable to do that for me - I always feel like the responsible one.\n\nTl;dr / TLDR - My boyfriend is a really sweet guy, but he has a serious problem with communicating when we disagree. Whenever I bring up an issue, he shuts down and goes into \u0022freeze mode.\u0022 It\u0027s so frustrating because we never actually resolve anything. I\u0027m starting to feel really neglected and unsupported, especially when it comes to my own needs. I love him, but I\u0027m not sure I can keep doing this.\n",

            "selftext": "My friend \u0022Adrian\u0022 and I met in a gaming community during covid.  Initially, it was a group of about 20 people, but in the last few years, we\u0027ve lost some people, gained others, and connected with other likeminded groups.  A lot of this connection making has been due to my work seeking out people with similar interests.  These days, Adrian and I are in a group of maybe 150 people who play several different games together.  Though I only have casual acquaintance with most of those people, there are a small number of people I\u0027ve gotten much closer to.  Adrian created a discord for this closer group to share our lives with eachother, and it\u0027s been a great group with which to talk about life, ask for advice, and celebrate or mourn big life events.   Some of us have even met in person!  I should also mention that though Adrian created the server, he does not run it it at all, and is one of the least active users.  It\u0027s considered by everyone to be Brenda\u0027s server.\n\nAdrian and I had a good relationship until about a year and a half ago, Adrian started accusing me of targeting him or manipulating him almost every time we played together.  I don\u0027t know why he believes I was doing this, but it caused a lot of arguments.  He doesn\u0027t accuse other people of this, and no one else thinks I\u0027m being skeevie like that.  When I wouldn\u0027t admit to manipulating him, he\u0027d get angry and accuse me of lying about it, then I\u0027d get angry he was accusing me of dishonesty, and things would spiral.  After about two months of this, I stopped playing any games he was participating in, and over time, our relationship mostly recovered.\n\nA few weeks ago, I tried to have a conversation about something a bit delicate with him, but it quickly devolved  the same way all our game arguments did, only much much worse.  When I would not confess to having malevolent intentions toward him, he told me he never wanted to speak to me again.  When he would not stop harassing me over my \u0022malevolent intentions\u0022, I blocked him.\n\nI then took a few days off the internet.  I had not expected the conversation I initiated with him to become an argument at \\*all\\*, much less one of that magnitude, and I have a husband and kids who always come first.

I offered a few of them my phone number, but only one took me up on that.\n\nI am wondering if anyone has advice on keeping in touch with my other friends, or patching things up with Adrian.

Initially, it was a group of about 20 people, but in the last few years, we\u0026amp;#39;ve lost some people, gained others, and connected with other likeminded groups.  A lot of this connection making has been due to my work seeking out people with similar interests.  These days, Adrian and I are in a group of maybe 150 people who play several different games together.  Though I only have casual acquaintance with most of those people, there are a small number of people I\u0026amp;#39;ve gotten much closer to.  Adrian created a discord for this closer group to share our lives with eachother, and it\u0026amp;#39;s been a great group with which to talk about life, ask for advice, and celebrate or mourn big life events.   Some of us have even met in person!  I should also mention that though Adrian created the server, he does not run it it at all, and is one of the least active users.  It\u0026amp;#39;s considered by everyone to be Brenda\u0026amp;#39;s server.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Adrian and I had a good relationship until about a year and a half ago, Adrian started accusing me of targeting him or manipulating him almost every time we played together.  I don\u0026amp;#39;t know why he believes I was doing this, but it caused a lot of arguments.  He doesn\u0026amp;#39;t accuse other people of this, and no one else thinks I\u0026amp;#39;m being skeevie like that.  When I wouldn\u0026amp;#39;t admit to manipulating him, he\u0026amp;#39;d get angry and accuse me of lying about it, then I\u0026amp;#39;d get angry he was accusing me of dishonesty, and things would spiral.  After about two months of this, I stopped playing any games he was participating in, and over time, our relationship mostly recovered.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A few weeks ago, I tried to have a conversation about something a bit delicate with him, but it quickly devolved  the same way all our game arguments did, only much much worse.  When I would not confess to having malevolent intentions toward him, he told me he never wanted to speak to me again.  When he would not stop harassing me over my \u0026amp;quot;malevolent intentions\u0026amp;quot;, I blocked him.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I then took a few days off the internet.

            "selftext": "I have been with my girlfriend for a bit over 4 years now. This is something that has been bothering me, mainly because we intend to get married in the future and I see the path that she wants to go down as a really poor financial decision. \n\nFor some background, I make about $95k a year and she makes about $85k a year, before taxes. However, she has about $30k in student loan debt, and $6-7k in credit card debt (I got her to put this on a balance transfer card with 0% interest for a set period of time, and she is working on paying this off). We also have a mortgage that we contribute equally to every month. I have been fortunate enough to not have any student loan debt or have to carry any credit card balance. The only debt I have is the mortgage which we co-own.   \n\n\nIn December, her three year lease on her personal car is ending, and she has the following options, as far as we know:\n\n1. Buyout the vehicle. It would be about $30k, and she would need to get an external loan to pay for the car, which of course would involve a hefty interest charge\n\n  \n2. Return the vehicle and get a new lease on a different vehicle. Right now she has a 2021 Infiniti QX 50, and she would want to get something comparable or better than that. \n\n  \n3. Return the vehicle and do not get any car. Instead, use her company vehicle, which she already uses for personal travel (this is allowed by the company), and save the monthly expenses on not having a personal vehicle.\n\n  \nShe pays about $700 a month for this vehicle. The lease payment itself is $500 and the insurance is $200. In my head, it is a no brainer to go with Option 3 and save the $700 a month and use that to pay off her credit card debt and student loans, or hell, even use it for leisure/travel. I have expressed this to her but she is heavily leaning towards option 1 or 2, which in my mind is a bad decision. \n\nHer main reasoning for not wanting to go with Option 3 is that she does not like her job, and is applying for different jobs, and she says her new job may not have a company vehicle. This is fair, but in my head, it would make more sense to go with Option 3 UNTIL she lands a new job that she is happy with and then she can, I would think, relatively easily get a car lease on a new vehicle. If she doesn\u0027t land a job for a while, then she can save on the $700 every month until that new job does come in. For context, she has been applying to new jobs on and off for about a year, but has not landed something that is in the same pay range as her current job. \n\n  \nIn general though, I think paying $700 a month is an absurdly high amount, given the previously mentioned circumstances. One compromise, in my head, would be to get a non-luxury vehicle with a significantly lower monthly payment. That way she at least inst paying so much on car rent when it feels so unnecessary, but she has expressed that she does not want to \u0022downgrade\u0022, so that option seems to be out of the window. \n\nOne other reason she cites for not wanting to return the vehicle is that the car is damaged and she will have to get the repairs done. This is true, but they are relatively minor cosmetic items ($1-2k max maybe), and she will need to get the repairs done eventually anyway. \n\n  \nI guess the intent of this post is to ask the following to the Reddit community:\n\n1. Am I being unreasonable or is there something I am missing? I just cant see how she does not see this as a great opportunity to save money, or pay off debt for the future, or again even use it for leisure. I\u0027m not sure what to do.\n\n2. If I am not being unreasonable, is there another approach I can use to get her to see my way? I don\u0027t have bad intentions.. I want us to be as financially well off as possible for our future, and I see this as a huge lost opportunity in that regard. We talked about it with some friends a few weeks ago and even they said the same thing, that she should just save on the money. \n\n  \n3. If I am being unreasonable, what options do I have? Unless I am missing something big, I can\u0027t see myself feeling comfortable about the decision. \n\n  \n\n\n",

This is true, but they are relatively minor cosmetic items ($1-2k max maybe), and she will need to get the repairs done eventually anyway. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I guess the intent of this post is to ask the following to the Reddit community:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ol\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Am I being unreasonable or is there something I am missing? I just cant see how she does not see this as a great opportunity to save money, or pay off debt for the future, or again even use it for leisure. I\u0026amp;#39;m not sure what to do.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If I am not being unreasonable, is there another approach I can use to get her to see my way? I don\u0026amp;#39;t have bad intentions.. I want us to be as financially well off as possible for our future, and I see this as a huge lost opportunity in that regard. We talked about it with some friends a few weeks ago and even they said the same thing, that she should just save on the money. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If I am being unreasonable, what options do I have? Unless I am missing something big, I can\u0026amp;#39;t see myself feeling comfortable about the decision. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ol\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

One important thing: for me, sex life is just one aspect of a relationship so please don\u2019t tell me to just leave him.\n\nBut let\u0027s start from the beginning.\n\nWhen I met my partner I was a virgin and he was more experienced than I was. I had to learn a lot of things bed-wise (mainly oral, I\u0027m not super frisky). My partner also tried oral on me but it didn\u0027t really work for me which is ok because I see sex more as intimacy and not it\u0027s-not-good-if-i-don\u0027t-finish kinda stuff.\n\nThings started changing when I noticed that my partner starting watching porn in order to finish. At first I didn\u0027t pay much attention to it because I thought that it\u0027s normal that he needs visual stimulation for a BJ so I didn\u0027t mind. But then he started watching it during intercourse and it kinda put me off because I thought that the only reason is that me and my body is not enough.\n\nAnd it\u0027s not like he watches it all the time but like... 80% (now that I\u0027m typing this I realize how crazy it sounds).\n\nWhen I brought this issue up he assured me that it\u0027s nothing and he thinks I\u0027m beautiful and hot but it\u0027s all about visual stimuli. So I let it go.\n\nA year has passed and nothing changed. So when I brought up the issue of me not being taken care of in bed (meaning that I enjoy intimate cuddling etc.) we\u0027ve decided that we can split 50-50: one time it\u0027s \u0022his\u0022 version of sex and the next one is \u0022mine\u0022. And even though it looked great on paper it never actually happened. Every time I suggested that now should be \u201Emy turn\u201D he always dismissed it as \u201Cnext time\u201D. And, surprisingly or not, the next time never came.\n\nNow this brings me back to a month or so. I brought up this issue during one of our arguments and my partner coldly stated \u201Cok, then I will not do it (meaning watching porn during sex) ever again\u201D. And I was satisfied for a moment because I didn\u2019t know that it would basically translate into: \u201Cyou made me do it so you can\u2019t complain now\u201D.\n\nSo here\u2019s how things are: the form of sex is the same (first oral on him then me on top, sometimes both of us on the side). But the thing is he always asks me to take a break after a while and that\u0027s the end. I can\u2019t even describe how shitty I\u2019m actually feeling. I\u2019ve brought this up with my therapist and she told me I should talk with my partner when he\u2019s ready for the topic. And when I did the conversation was basically one-sided: that I got what I wanted and I can\u2019t complain because if we go back (to the non-existing 50-50 rule as I have suggested it again) I will change my mind again and he will be hurting me this way. Si he prefers to not watch porn at all.\n\nThe thing is that during the night I can feel him masturbating to porn \u2013 and I understand the need because there is no outlet for him. But I have no idea what to do. I feel absolutely worthless, ugly and mean. When I try to bring this issue up at any time he gets really defensive and angry, suggesting that it\u2019s my fault and he\u2019s doing what I asked.\n\nPlease help me. I\u2019m lost for words. My therapist noticed that I\u2019m regressing into my state from before I\u2019ve started therapy (heavy dissociation, making myself invisible and unproblematic at the cost of my mental well-being) because this issue is gnawing at me all the time. I feel that my partner is weaponizing his problem against me. I just really want him to be with me at the moment, I understand that sometimes there are sex problems in relationships but if that\u2019s the case shouldn\u2019t he be doing something about it? I\u2019ve tried my best at discussing this issue but I keep thinking that this is just going to be my life from now until forever because I can\u2019t do anything about it.\n\nI feel absolutely awful every single day and I just keep fighting his perspective and feel guilty and helpless. I tried to think of a way out of this situation but I\u0027m at a loss.\n\nSorry for the long post. Please help. What can I do?",

It was a 5 point difference. Anyway. I was with 5 hours of sleep, i woke up, got to the test, when i left family called that my grandpa is sick and he s in the hospital receiving oxygen and treatment and everything and that he\u0027s close to dying, i drove 2 hours to get there , on the way there the test result came and i found out that i failed, i saw my grandpa in a difficult situation with my whole family gathered, i got back again 2 hours of driving and i planned on going for a coffee with my girlfriend. \n\nI wrote to her that im coming close to her appartment. She told me she left the home and she s on her way. When i got there, i called her and she said she s on the way (mentioning a specific place) but then when i asked her where she was because i wanted to clarify the meeting point, she hung up on me. I called her immediately again, and she didnt answer. A minute later she comes out of her appartment,because i did drive by her door, and when i called i was just afraid we re gonna get confused about us meeting and wanted to let her know im close, anyway, she started apologizing for her not being honest because she was late and ok this was fine i swear i didnt mind but then i just asked her why didnt u pick up and she looked me in the eyes and said: i didnt hear iit, the phone hung up itseelf etcetc. Which pissed me off a little because i just dont like being lied to. Being lied is what i perceive as being considered vulnerable and stupid. Anyway we went to a coffee and clearly i was mad and wasnt talking to her for like 10 minutes, i was watching a game, expecting her to just realise she was wrong and apologise. Then she says after 10 mins are we talking now or do u prefer watching the game. I looked at her and said: i wanna watch the game. She then ditched me in the coffee bar. 5 mins later i got up and got home. We haven\u0027t talked since. What do you think?",

We didn\u0027t talk about that for the rest of the date but as soon as he could after the date he texted me to talk about the situation and apologised. He accepted what he did was wrong and that he wouldn\u0027t avoid accountability for it and he said that nothing justifies what he did and he doesn\u0027t want forgiveness but a second chance to show that he isn\u0027t someone who would do that and he doesn\u0027t know why he did that and i thought that id give him the chance and then we had our fourth date and he didn\u0027t touch me anywhere without my consent even once , he asked me before every touch and even when i hugged him before leaving he didn\u0027t hug me back initially and later he was trying his best to place his hands in such a way that it doesn\u0027t touch my bra or make me uncomfortable.\n\nHe maintains a small note on his phone on things he shouldn\u0027t do with me after he knows his mistake and he added it to him and we have discussed that it is a non negotiable between us to not touch someone without consent and he agreed and whenever i wanted to talk about it he was always more than open to it and was always supportive and accepted his role in it\n\nHe later told me that he genuinely felt disgusted at himself after our 3rd date where he did that , he couldn\u0027t look at himself in the mirror or even see my pictures without feeling guilty or disgusted at himself , and he says he feels helpless since he can\u0027t do anything for me as he was the one who did that.\n\nBut i still dont feel comfortable about the entire incident , its been 2 months since it happened , i feel violated like my consent doesn\u0027t matter (i told this to him earlier and he assured me that that isn\u0027t the case and that my consent matters to him) and i feel lonely because i feel like if i tell any of my friends they\u0027ll think why am i staying with him even after all this happened and so i cant tell anyone and I don\u0027t know what to think of it\n\nTldr - Boyfriend touched me once without consent , talked to me asap , said he wants a second chance and never did it again and idk what to feel about it",

We didn\u0026amp;#39;t talk about that for the rest of the date but as soon as he could after the date he texted me to talk about the situation and apologised. He accepted what he did was wrong and that he wouldn\u0026amp;#39;t avoid accountability for it and he said that nothing justifies what he did and he doesn\u0026amp;#39;t want forgiveness but a second chance to show that he isn\u0026amp;#39;t someone who would do that and he doesn\u0026amp;#39;t know why he did that and i thought that id give him the chance and then we had our fourth date and he didn\u0026amp;#39;t touch me anywhere without my consent even once , he asked me before every touch and even when i hugged him before leaving he didn\u0026amp;#39;t hug me back initially and later he was trying his best to place his hands in such a way that it doesn\u0026amp;#39;t touch my bra or make me uncomfortable.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;He maintains a small note on his phone on things he shouldn\u0026amp;#39;t do with me after he knows his mistake and he added it to him and we have discussed that it is a non negotiable between us to not touch someone without consent and he agreed and whenever i wanted to talk about it he was always more than open to it and was always supportive and accepted his role in it\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;He later told me that he genuinely felt disgusted at himself after our 3rd date where he did that , he couldn\u0026amp;#39;t look at himself in the mirror or even see my pictures without feeling guilty or disgusted at himself , and he says he feels helpless since he can\u0026amp;#39;t do anything for me as he was the one who did that.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;But i still dont feel comfortable about the entire incident , its been 2 months since it happened , i feel violated like my consent doesn\u0026amp;#39;t matter (i told this to him earlier and he assured me that that isn\u0026amp;#39;t the case and that my consent matters to him) and i feel lonely because i feel like if i tell any of my friends they\u0026amp;#39;ll think why am i staying with him even after all this happened and so i cant tell anyone and I don\u0026amp;#39;t know what to think of it\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Tldr - Boyfriend touched me once without consent , talked to me asap , said he wants a second chance and never did it again and idk what to feel about it\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

            "selftext": "\nHow long until you exit a relationship which is not sexually intimate?\n\nIts been 2.5 years that me (33M) and my partner (35F) haven\u0027t had sex. We have been together for 4 years. Our relationship was rocky from the start and fights often got out of hand, like police involved or danger involved. Then, as a result of too much fighting, i relapsed on my DOC and became emotionally vacant. 8 months ago, I got sober. And we havent had any major fights (just normal arguments) since that time, but we still havent been sexually intimate for 2.5 years. I thought when i returned to sobriety, that would be the first thing that would change, as I have discussed with my partner on multiple occasions that I stopped caring because we arent romantically intimate, and that separation led me to escapism. While I would never punish myself again like that, I am a bit confused and concerned about this issue. She is often moody and unhappy with me, but over normal things that she takes out of hand. Like I spilled a bit of water on the floor in the bathroom and didnt notice it. I am quite used to being devalued and made to feel lesser than her, and thats partially okay with me. In fact, i am old fashioned and believe that women come first and men can be like the *emotional* punching bags for women in some ways. To be clear, this was the relationship dynamic before relapsing, during my relapse, and after my return to sobriety. So I dont think I created her temper. But anyways, I just dont see how this is going to work much longer. Deep down, i really feel the sexual intimacy would heal everything, and im not the type of person who loves sex or even wants it often. I just think there is this wall of distrust between us and maybe, shes scared of sex a little? Ive tried talking to her countless times about this subject, and if it doesnt upset her instantly then shell usually say to be quiet cause neighbours can hear us talking about private stuff. She is hyper sensitive and its kind of like everything has to be perfect for her to feel sexually interested, which ignores the fact that im kind of just putting myself out there and getting rejected by her for years on end. In our first year together, we had sex a handful of times but I was never able to go in all the way. She claims my dick is too big, and I know that with the right tempo and mood, its possible to do it. But basically, we havent had a proper orgasm together the whole time weve been together (but got close twice). I think she has trauma and doesnt want the hastle it takes to get stretched open properly, nd maybe im not able to keep her sexually aroused long enough to make it happen. But she hasnt had a partner or sex for 15 years, while i am moderately experienced, and regularly had sex in my 20s. In sum, i love her for who she is very much. But im wondering how long would all tolerate a no sex relationship, where there are regularly days where your woman is upset with you and wont talk with you for 24 hours\u002B or blames you for everything being wrong. An examplr of a fight: she tells me not to drive over bumps on a motorcycle, but doesnt have a liscence or experience driving. She gets upset i drove over too many bumps, doesnt talk to me for the whole day and locks me out of the bedroom. When we talk about, its my fault. I know from the past to not feed into her chaos, so we dont fight in a seripus capacity anymore. And im definitely not a perfect angel. But im wondering of I\u0027m just maintaining a ship that is sooner or later going to crash? I want to have sex and be with a partner who gives me the love I think I deserve. I am an attractive male (healthy, fit, naturally good looks), so i know I could move on easily, but I do love her. Ive never cheated on her or even went on a date with another girl in between break ups. But I really feel tempted sometimes. Ive tried the reverse psychology technique where I just treat her like she doesnt matter, and she basically just says \u0022fine, just leave and never come back\u0022 and then cries after im gone. \n\nEssentially, I want to know should I approach this subject with her?\n I know i cant pressure sex, and shes not the type of person to even plan it because then it will be uncomfortable. But ANY time ive tried to make a move (literally 100s of times) she rejects me. Ive tried making it super special. I get a super cute airbnb, go deep out in nature, take her out for a special dinner. Ive tried so many things, and its never like im treating her this way just for sex, but what im saying is ive tried going extra over the top to see if that has any effect. I am normally a giving partner to begin with. ",

However, there has been a decrease on those messages. We don\u0026amp;#39;t text each other that long anymore. He still greets me with good morning texts and i love you\u0026amp;#39;s every morning. He updates me all throughout the day. We talk to each other every night.\nBut the lengthy texts have disappeared.\nDo you think I should be bothered that he loves me less now? Is this normal?\nI can\u0026amp;#39;t help but reminisce those days when we first started dating. Although he gives me assurances, it still makes me sad when I think about it. We\u0026amp;#39;ve been dating for 1.6 years now. We are each other\u0026amp;#39;s first relationships. I am just clueless about things like this.\nFor couples who are experts in relationships or those who are in long term relationships. Can you give me your thoughts?

And now\u2026.ever since I found out I was pregnant, I have gained most of it back. It\u2019s early pregnancy and I think it is bloating and me cutting back on extensive exercise since it is early on and I have had a miscarriage in the past. So needless to say, my self confidence has taken a big hit.

(He has mostly dated more petite women before me)\n\nThere are many more little things like that, but those are a few to kind of provide a tone. He never says them outright mean-like, he always laughs them off. But I took them to heart. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to reassure myself that I\u2019m not some ugly monster he got with only because he has low self esteem. How do I tell myself I am pretty even though I may not be his type. How do I quit crying every day because I don\u2019t think I\u2019m enough. Yes I realize some of it is just hormones. I have told him all of this and he says he\u2019s sorry I feel that way, he thinks I\u2019m pretty, and then asks how he can help reassure me. But honestly, I don\u2019t even know how he can reassure me. He tells me I\u2019m pretty usually once a day, but it\u2019s just the simple \u201Cyou\u2019re so pretty\u201D so it feels kind of\u2026.placating, or like he\u2019s just throwing it out there to tell me.

But now I\u2019m overly focusing on any negative thing he has ever had to say about my body. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Like when I wear heels and am as tall as him and he said \u201CI don\u2019t know how I feel about you being as tall as me, it\u2019s weird\u201D and he laughed it off. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Like when he told me my boobs were too big. (He has mostly dated more petite women before me)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;There are many more little things like that, but those are a few to kind of provide a tone. He never says them outright mean-like, he always laughs them off. But I took them to heart. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I don\u2019t know how to reassure myself that I\u2019m not some ugly monster he got with only because he has low self esteem. How do I tell myself I am pretty even though I may not be his type. How do I quit crying every day because I don\u2019t think I\u2019m enough. Yes I realize some of it is just hormones. I have told him all of this and he says he\u2019s sorry I feel that way, he thinks I\u2019m pretty, and then asks how he can help reassure me. But honestly, I don\u2019t even know how he can reassure me. He tells me I\u2019m pretty usually once a day, but it\u2019s just the simple \u201Cyou\u2019re so pretty\u201D so it feels kind of\u2026.placating, or like he\u2019s just throwing it out there to tell me. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

Today, after openly masturbating, my BIL tried to massage my mom (who has been dealing with shoulder and hip pain) after she vocalized dealing with the pain. My mom wasn\u0027t interested in touch/massage so tried to dismiss him and moved to a different part of the house where my BIL followed her and continued to massage her before pressing himself against her, touching her butt, and starting to rub her hips and trying to move his hands to her vagina. My mom forcibly stopped him and left the room, avoiding him for the rest of the time that she was home.\n\nSome more background: my mom is retired, while Sarah works a normal 9-5 job and BIL works a night shift, so there\u0027s several hours during the morning \u0026amp; afternoon where my mother and BIL are home alone together (as was the case today during the above incident). My mom is out of the house for this evening, and myself (30m) and my other sister (Melissa - 35) have ensured that she has somewhere other than home to stay tonight. Sarah has been informed of what happened by my mom and stated that she will discuss the issue with BIL tonight. The issue with this is that Sarah has defended questionable actions of BIL in the past (self-injury due to anger issues, an instance of sexual harassment - just learned of this one as well, other boundary-crossing issues) and I and Melissa feel like this is unforgivable and the ONLY appropriate action is Sarah insisting on BIL leaving the house permanently. What would be the best way to handle this situation?",

I graduated university this past May and she graduated the year before me. We knew my job was going to relocate me in July to a different city after graduation, and she had been living at home since her job is fully remote. We have been long distance (about a 4 hour drive) since she graduated last year and she typically would come stay with me for a month or two at school since I lived by myself in an apartment, and then go home for a bit. Now our long distance situation has changed in to a 2 hour\u002B plane ride or 12 hour drive, which is obviously significantly more challenging. \n\nOur original plan was to move in together shortly after I graduated and settled in my new city. We looked at apartments, discussed finances, figuring out an office situation for her, really the whole 9. As it got closer to me signing a lease, we decided that it may not be the right time for her to move to a new city just for me quite yet. I didn\u0027t want a the situation turning into her isolating herself just to be with me. This was disappointing but okay since she was planning to move in with one of her close friends in a city within reasonable driving distance in November. \n\n  \nIt\u0027s been four months of living in my new city and we\u0027ve seen each other twice, once for 2 days and another time for 3-4 weeks. She left a few days ago after being here the last couple weeks. Again, we\u0027ve been accustomed to staying with each other for about a month on and a month off for the past year. Moving in with her friend seems to have fallen through, so I brought up her moving in here again this past trip. I feel very mentally strained by our long distance, the constant planning to travel, time apart, and general difficulties of being long distance are adding a lot of mental load. I need a break from the long distance and we\u0027ve been together for a while, for me I\u0027m ready for the next step of actually living together. \n\nI understand we are young, so I don\u0027t imagine us living together the entirety of our 20s as I\u0027m sure our lives will take us different places again and I want us to be able to live with friends again, but for right now it seems to make sense. It\u0027s been a while since we\u0027ve been in the same city and moving somewhere new seems like a perfect way to start off a new adventure. Her reserves have been that she doesn\u0027t have as much of a network as I do here, which I completely understand and is scary. On the other hand having to build friends and relationships in new places kind of comes with the territory of being in your 20s and moving out. \n\n  \nAnyways, I don\u0027t really know how to move forward. It feels like we are in some ultimatum stage because long distance is getting so much harder, but it doesn\u0027t seem like she\u0027s ready to take the next step after nearly 2 years together. \n\n  \n\\[other thoughts\\] I have two other friends who live in the same city who\u0027s partners have moved here to be with them because their jobs were more flexible, both of which are the same ages as us. It just makes me feel even more stuck feeling like she\u0027ll never be ready to take that next step together. \n\n",

I started dating my gf 6 years ago. Our sex life was amazing and personality-wise everything just seemed to click. Pretty early on in our relationship she got diagnosed with depression. We both were pretty sure something was wrong so she went to a psychiatrist and turns out we were right. I\u0027ve been with her and supported her through it for several years, always being there for her when she needed me. We got separated by COVID, when she went to live for 6 months to another state with her family. After 6 more months, we then again got separated for another year due to her career. We\u0027ve gone through all this and now we\u0027ve been living together for almost 3 years. Our relationship isn\u0027t perfect and we\u0027ve had a couple rough patches, but we love each other and have a lot of fun together.\n\nI love her with all my heart. She used to be the thing that brought joy to my life. She\u0027s the best partner I\u0027ve ever had (granted I may not have much experience, just 1 other serious relationship and a couple of flings), but she\u0027s caring, loving and so cute and dorky in the best way. We just click on so many levels. Our life together is almost perfect. I had never had someone care so deeply for me and treat me so well. She will make dinner if I\u0027m tired, she will listen to me rant when something\u0027s wrong, she will always support me. She\u0027s like a 10 out of 10 emotionally speaking.\n\nHowever, when she started taking medication for her depression her libido completely died. She was on anti-depressants for 3 years and stopped taking them a bit more than a year ago. Since she started taking the medication, we went from being intimate 3-4 times a week to maybe once a month. Not only that, but the quality of our \u0022sexy\u0022 time together also decreased a lot. We went from having crazy fun sex to a boring, almost routine-like sex life. She never initiates anymore. She refuses my approaches 9 out of 10 times. She doesn\u0027t want to try any new things, and we\u0027ve become stuck in this cycle of not having sex for 3-5 weeks, then having sex once with her on starfish mode, then 3-5 weeks again.\n\nShe won\u0027t even go down on me. I know this complaint may sound ridiculous, but I love going down on her and she used to love reciprocating. I go down on her literally every time we\u0027re intimate because I know she enjoys it and I can see the pleasure it gives her. But in all the time we\u0027ve been living together (even a bit more) she hasn\u0027t reciprocated once. I know sex is not everything but I\u0027m kind of desperate.\n\nWhen she got off her meds, I thought things might change. I\u0027ve talked to her about the issue several times. I asked her if I could do something to be more attractive to her. She told me I had put on some weight since we started dating (30 lbs) so I went to the gym and lost almost 25 lbs. Which may not be a lot but I put in a lot of effort to, and I\u0027m still working on it. I also mentioned that maybe we could try to spice things up and she said she didn\u0027t feel like doing anything. When I tried to mention the oral sex, saying that she used to enjoy both giving and taking, she said \u0022well I also used to be a \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* who went clubbing and hooked up with whoever\u0022. Which tbh I don\u0027t feel has anything to do with reciprocating oral sex but whatever. Our last talk on the subject of sex ended on her saying that she wouldn\u0027t let something as banal as sex make her sad when she\u0027s fought so much to overcome her depression and have the happiness she currently has.\n\nI can tell that she\u0027s putting a lot of effort in too. She overcame hell and I\u0027m super proud of her. She\u0027s so much better mentally than I\u0027ve ever seen her, and stronger every day. And I know there are times where she doesn\u0027t feel like being intimate but she makes an effort and tries to enjoy it with me. I always stop her and ask her if she really feels like it, and I try to let her know that there\u0027s no pressure and she shouldn\u0027t do anything if she\u0027s not comfortable or into it. But seeing as this has been going on for more than 4 out of our 6 years together I\u0027m starting to rethink our relationship. I don\u0027t want to have my sex life reduced to me jerking off in the bathroom 4 times a week and then hoping for 1 boring and dull session a month, or every two months. I\u0027ve been feeling depressed and ugly and fat and undesirable for a long time, but since last June it\u0027s gotten much worse. I\u0027ve spent entire nights sleepless trying to think if it\u0027s worth it to keep going. I love her. I want to be with her. But I am at a point where I don\u0027t know if I can keep doing this.\n\nMy main doubt is: Is it worth it to approach this issue again? It wouldn\u0027t be the first time, or the second. I don\u0027t know if I should break up with her. Aside from our sex life, there are a couple other issues that make me doubt if we have a clear path ahead:\n\nMainly 2. First, I want children. I\u0027ve always wanted kids. But whenever I bring up the issue she keeps dodging the question with awkward jokes, and when we\u0027re taking a walk or at a restaurant/cinema/public transport and she sees a baby I can see her facial expression and it\u0027s not \u0022awwww\u0022 it\u0027s more like a mix between \u0022ew\u0022 and \u0022ugh\u0022. Second, she\u0027s very different to me politically speaking. We\u0027re not in the States, but she votes for a far-right political party that is actively trying to erase my cultural identity, language, and heritage from schools, public entities, etc. I, on the other hand, am super left-leaning, and obviously would rather my culture, lenguage, and heritage to stay as they are. Her parents are just like her but more radical in this regard. The thing is, she\u0027s not homophobic or racist. In fact, she\u0027s pretty left-leaning on most social and economical issues, but the culture issue is so important to her that she votes for a far-right party regardless. This has been one of the main problems of our relationship and I\u0027ve learnt to sort of ignore it/accept it.\n\nTL;DR: Together for 6\u002B years. Beginning-1.5 years all good. 1.5 years-5 years she gets diagnosed with a depression, we get separated by covid \u002B work, she starts taking antidepressants, our sex life goes to shit. 5 years - present she has stopped taking anti-depressants, sex life is still shit. Talked about it numerous times, nothing changes. We\u0027ve both put effort to change things but nothing changes. What to do?",

As the title says. I started dating my gf 6 years ago. Our sex life was amazing and personality-wise everything just seemed to click. Pretty early on in our relationship she got diagnosed with depression. We both were pretty sure something was wrong so she went to a psychiatrist and turns out we were right. I\u0026amp;#39;ve been with her and supported her through it for several years, always being there for her when she needed me. We got separated by COVID, when she went to live for 6 months to another state with her family. After 6 more months, we then again got separated for another year due to her career.

Recently, a guy she has hooked up with asked her if she wants to \u0022see each other.\u0022 They have not talked or anything for past couple of months, and from my understanding they were never really friends just used each other for sex.\n\nI believed we have a fairly healthy amount of trust in our relationship, but now I\u0027m starting to doubt my trust in her (which I know is bad.) But for some reason I really feel uneasy about the situation and uncomfortable about it. She has stated that she doesn\u0027t want to see him, but still says she will text him saying they can have a \u0022friendly meet up.\u0022 To me it just feels confusing to why she would say she doesn\u0027t want to see him, but then still want to text him to meet up.\n\nOverall, I would prefer her not to see him. But I feel it is unjust for me to say that I don\u0027t want her to see him, when she was direct about him texting in the first place. This is why I have turned to reddit for help, as I don\u0027t want to come off as a bad person telling her I prefer she doesn\u0027t see him.\n\nI\u0027m just looking for advice and anyones opinions/views on the situation.\n\nTLDR: Girlfriend wants to meet up with guy she used to see, and I feel uneasy about the situation.",

Recently, a guy she has hooked up with asked her if she wants to \u0026amp;quot;see each other.\u0026amp;quot; They have not talked or anything for past couple of months, and from my understanding they were never really friends just used each other for sex.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I believed we have a fairly healthy amount of trust in our relationship, but now I\u0026amp;#39;m starting to doubt my trust in her (which I know is bad.) But for some reason I really feel uneasy about the situation and uncomfortable about it. She has stated that she doesn\u0026amp;#39;t want to see him, but still says she will text him saying they can have a \u0026amp;quot;friendly meet up.\u0026amp;quot; To me it just feels confusing to why she would say she doesn\u0026amp;#39;t want to see him, but then still want to text him to meet up.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Overall, I would prefer her not to see him. But I feel it is unjust for me to say that I don\u0026amp;#39;t want her to see him, when she was direct about him texting in the first place. This is why I have turned to reddit for help, as I don\u0026amp;#39;t want to come off as a bad person telling her I prefer she doesn\u0026amp;#39;t see him.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I\u0026amp;#39;m just looking for advice and anyones opinions/views on the situation.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;TLDR: Girlfriend wants to meet up with guy she used to see, and I feel uneasy about the situation.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

And I think I finally hit a breaking point but I don\u2019t want to be unfair so advice would be greatly appreciated. \nSorry in advance for the length, idk about to convey this fairly otherwise. \n\nOkay, to begin with my parents got pregnant with me after 3ish months of dating. They married when she was 7months pregnant. I found out about 5years ago that she called her ex on their wedding day. Her ex and her broke up when she moved back to the States. Whenever she talked about her experience moving back she laughed about leaving him heart broken. \n\nMy parents had a rough relationship. When I was about 13, my mom was doing well work wise and started an affair with someone from work. She made it very apparent to my whole family that she was over my dad and deserved her independence. Both, my parents, would drag my brother and me into the fights. I supported her leaving my dad and whatever would make her happy. She eventually left, moved out, dated the guy from the affair (he was also married). They actually ended because she got mad about him and told his wife about him cheating. \n\nAnyways, eventually work went downhill for her so she moved back with my dad. They eventually reconciled and got back together. They actually got along and had good relationship (from what I can tell). \n\nI moved, had a break up, and got in the best relationship of my life (we got married!). About 6months into my new relationship, my parents\u2019 relationship started to go sideways again. They randomly call me to solve their fights. It was stressful. Eventually we find out my mom is having an affair with her boyfriend from Mexico (the one from before I was born). She still lived at my dad\u2019s. This brought out the worse in my dad.  Eventually she moved out and into my aunt\u2019s, which is what I told her to do from the beginning. \n\n(Side note: her ex was also married when they started talking. He also has a family with grown children.)\n\nSince she\u2019s moved back to Mexico to be with him and I\u2019ve gotten married. She skipped my wedding even though I invited her. The week of my wedding called me telling she was going to visit me the day before my wedding and that she was already in the States to do so. I asked her not to come. Later she admitted not wanting to come to the wedding because it would be awkward for her. \n\nOf course I was mad at her for everything but she\u2019s an adult and I just tired to be patience (the best I could), we\u2019re at the point that I call her once a week and visit when we can. During this week\u2019s call, after asking I found out she married that guy back in April. I was suspicious because his citizenship process was \u201Crandomly expedited\u201D. When she was here in April, she claimed it was for my brother\u2019s bday but now the truth is out. \n\nI\u2019m really done and don\u2019t want a relationship with her. Would it be wrong of me?\n\nI\u2019m skipping lots like her not talking to me for months because she claimed I was snobby for going to college. My dad had to convince her to talk to me again. But this is long enough \uD83D\uDE05 sorry again!",

We live 4000 miles away so we only see each other a few times a year. \nBackstory: we\u2019ve known each other since we were babies and grew up with each other until we were about 10. There was definitely a crush between us growing up and he would give me gifts saying he really liked me. We even shared our first kiss together and \u201Cgot married\u201D because our friends thought it was funny. We were 10. Then he moves to Alaska and we didn\u2019t talk for a few years but social media made that possible once we were in middle and high school and you could tell there was still something between us. We would text almost every day until a little after graduation when we went our separate ways again only texting occasionally. Fast forward to August 2022 where we ran into each other at my hometown\u2019s picnic, where we used to run around and I still live. We hit it off easily and caught up in no time. I felt that old feeling making its way up but I ignored it as I was seeing someone at the time even though my current boyfriend tried for a few months. Fast forward again to the next August and he was back again. This time I was single so I went for it and here we are a year later happier than ever. Or so I thought. \nHere\u2019s where my problem lies. He has a fantastic job at the electric company and is in the union and makes lots of money. If he stays on for 15 more years he can retire at 45 and be completely done which is a dream to him. I on the other hand am a teacher at my high school and am definitely a homebody. I\u2019m an only child and live next door to my dad. We are all each other has since my mom died of cancer 7 years ago. I\u2019m all about family immediate and extended and love my hometown and my farm. (Plus it\u2019s warm here and not in Alaska lol). Also, most of my boyfriend\u2019s extended family lives in my town too including his grandma. \nMy boyfriend just informed me last night that he plans on buying a house up there where he lives and staying at the electric company until he retires in 15 years. I understand why he wants to do that but I hate it. I don\u2019t want to be doing long distance for another 15 years only seeing each other a few times a year and never getting to have a family or come home to each other every day. I want to marry him and there\u2019s times where he hints at wanting that too. But know I don\u2019t know since he revealed this to me last night. His job is available where I live too and while he won\u2019t be making the same he won\u2019t be losing money because the cost of living is so much lower in Kentucky. He thinks he won\u2019t be able to do the projects he wants to do because of less money even though I tell him things cost less here. I did tell him that I still love him and we are just going to have to talk this over until we can come up with something as a solution. I don\u2019t want to lose him because he\u2019s the best thing to ever come into my life and we really have been perfect for each other from the beginning which makes this so hard for me to think about.

            "selftext": "Brief introduction. \n\nM31 here. Been with my Partner F34 for almost 8 years. Been engaged since sept 22. Mostly we\u2019ve had a great relationship , always having fun , never taking each other too seriously and just enjoying life together. We\u2019ve never really had any major argument\u2019s throughout our relationship  , we\u2019re both really laid back which I can see now is a major issue when it comes to communication. As I mentioned previously we\u2019ve been engaged since 2022 and have lived together since the start of 2022 also. We\u2019ve both been working hard towards our careers , she has had several promotions and has a very good job within her industry. I have been training to become a tradesman for the last 2 years also - both with an aim to own a house together and start a family. \n\nNow , I\u2019ve always had a job before getting into a trade , however due to varying reasons - short term contracts etc this has meant I\u2019ve worked several different places doing several different things with no real job security. Thinking to the future this is what has pushed me to train to specialise in a trade and create a stable foundation to build a family.  ( I feel this was the correct way to do things , especially as we both wanted to buy a house together so job security was a must. My partner however resents this somewhat and thinks I should\u2019ve just taken any \u2018full time job\u2019. She believes the fact I haven\u2019t isn\u2019t really showing that I have the same goals as her. I\u2019ve tried to explain that whilst I would go for any full time job , I strongly believe you need to be happy in what you\u2019re doing. She said she understands and agrees somewhat but still believes we don\u2019t want the same things i.e house and family. I couldn\u2019t want anything more than those things and felt that training to learn a trade is having ambition to be the best I can be. For us. \n\nAs for her , she\u2019s excelled rapidly in her career in the last 5 years she\u2019s gone from a shop floor worker to senior management. I\u2019m extremely proud of her , she\u2019s a very driven and motivated woman and I love her passion to be the best she can. However the reality is she\u2019s stressed out more than not. When having conversations about it she say she loves her job which I truely believe she does but the demand on what is required from her is still extremely stressful. She\u2019s coming home stressed , angry, upset fairly frequently , and her response is that\u2019s just part of the job. But I don\u2019t believe she sees the impact this has on our relationship. This has caused her recently to question as I mentioned if we want the same things - if we want the same out of life , same priorities etc.  I literally want exactly what she wants , but it\u2019s like she cannot accept or believe that. It has really created a lot of distance between us , from an intimate POV. \n\nI try to relate to this as I had a very similar job which I took because it was \u2018fulltime\u2019. Did I want this job No. I wasn\u2019t interested in it at all but I took it , one to try it as it may have changed my mind , but also for us to show I want a stable foundation for us. Anyway to cut a long story short , I was promised fast progression etc etc but instead I was treat so badly , which ultimately caused depression. This had a major effect on our relationship as I pushed her away , not intentionally , but I just shut myself down , I was exhausted , I wasn\u2019t happy. \n\nShe was absolutely nothing to do with my unhappiness , but I know she felt like she was. I voiced my concerns and left the job 6 months later - and it was like an instant lift off my shoulders , we as a couple were growing closer again I was happier, life was better. Although I did feel a slight judgement for leaving fulltime work once again for short term contract job. \n\n\nI have done this same short term job for the previous 7 years, in which I worked my way up to become an assistant manager. Still it isn\u2019t a full time job due to it being seasonal working. This however has potentially opened doors to gain a fulltime job within this area in the future , but my partner doesn\u2019t believe anything would come of this. And there are no real prospects. \n\nFrom this point that is when I embarked on my trade training alongside doing the seasonal job. \nSo fast forward to 2023- and the conversation comes again , do we really want the same thing , are we on the same page \n\nFrom my point of view we were, I had the same goals in mind as she did but again she just cant seem to see this. This is where I began to get worried as she was really doubting us. \n\nThis is where I asked specifically what is it about us that\u2019s wrong and she couldn\u2019t give me any sort of real reason other than potentially wanting different things. We agreed to chat about a few days later once we\u2019d both cooled off but we never did. \n\nIt was like everything just went straight back to normal and nothing was wrong. This is where our lack of laid-backness was destructive from both sides. Neither of us initiated a conversation as everything seemed to be going ok. I do kick myself for not bringing it up, but I just didn\u2019t have the confidence to talk about it without it partially causing an argument and upset. \n\nThis soon bottled up until this year where she brought it up again. So I said we really need to talk about this , work out what we both want and communicate effectively. It was so difficult so communicate with her as she would just refer back to wanting different things. So now I\u2019m like ok , you wanted a house and a family. If it\u2019s me you don\u2019t want then why aren\u2019t you just saying that And she just said she doesn\u2019t know what she wants she just needs space. \n\nThis was all during a high period is stress at work for her. ( I\u2019m not blaming it on work , but I feel like this could be negatively impacting her views on our relationship etc )\n\nSo i gave her the space - but that was 3 months ago. She moved back with her family , but we still regularly hang out and see each other. So it\u2019s so confusing for me as she says we will sit down and talk about everything but we\u2019re still yet to do so. As soon as I try mention us , she try\u2019s to change the subject. I have asked what it is she wants and needs but she can\u2019t tell me that either. \n\nI appreciate people change etc , but it just hurts knowing I do want what she does. She\u2019s the woman I\u2019ve set up to spend the rest of my life with but somehow doesn\u2019t think I want that. \n\nI\u2019ve tried suggesting couples therapy which she\u2019s said maybe. But just feels like we\u2019re stuck in limbo - nothings progressing either way. It\u2019s like we\u2019ve just paused our relationship. \n\nCan anyone share any advice if they\u2019ve been in a similar situation?  ",

I love her very much and I know she loves me too. \n\nHowever for some reason she\u2019s made a few remarks from time to time that she wishes I was taller. I\u2019ve always kinda looked at it as sarcasm on her part because I am 6 feet tall, so by no means short. She is 5\u20185, so the height difference is pretty noticeable. \n\nThis weekend however we were talking about types and she told me that I am by far the shortest guy she\u2019s ever been on a date with. Again nothing serious, especially because I\u2019m her first bf and nothing ever came from her other dates.\n\nBut it made me think back at all those tiny remarks and I think she might have been serious about me being too short for her which obviously makes me feel very sad, especially because I didn\u2019t see her as a shallow person at all.\n\nFor context: I don\u2019t think she finds me unattractive. She initiates sex way more than me and even tho initially she told me she doesn\u2019t really like sex (based on her few experiences before me). She gives me tones of compliments and honestly it would make 0 sense for her to be with me because rn I have nothing to offer except myself. \nShe also isn\u2019t shallow at all, so all of this caught me off guard and idk what to think about this.\n\nBefore I confront her I\u2019d like some objective input. Am I overthinking this?\n\nTLDR: I think my gf might think that I\u2019m too short and idk if I\u2019m overreacting or if I should be freaking out like this.",

I love her very much and I know she loves me too. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;However for some reason she\u2019s made a few remarks from time to time that she wishes I was taller. I\u2019ve always kinda looked at it as sarcasm on her part because I am 6 feet tall, so by no means short. She is 5\u20185, so the height difference is pretty noticeable. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This weekend however we were talking about types and she told me that I am by far the shortest guy she\u2019s ever been on a date with. Again nothing serious, especially because I\u2019m her first bf and nothing ever came from her other dates.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;But it made me think back at all those tiny remarks and I think she might have been serious about me being too short for her which obviously makes me feel very sad, especially because I didn\u2019t see her as a shallow person at all.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;For context: I don\u2019t think she finds me unattractive. She initiates sex way more than me and even tho initially she told me she doesn\u2019t really like sex (based on her few experiences before me). She gives me tones of compliments and honestly it would make 0 sense for her to be with me because rn I have nothing to offer except myself. \nShe also isn\u2019t shallow at all, so all of this caught me off guard and idk what to think about this.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Before I confront her I\u2019d like some objective input. Am I overthinking this?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;TLDR: I think my gf might think that I\u2019m too short and idk if I\u2019m overreacting or if I should be freaking out like this.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

We have talked about our future, and while I wasn\u0027t down for a joint savings account, I really liked the idea and that he wanted to set aside money for our future goals. We agreed on a specific savings account that I had recommended, he agreed and said he would set his up. Fast forward 6 weeks (I have put 3 installments in my account, totalling $150). \nWe are driving to my place the other night and I ask him if he has had a chance to set up his account yet. He tells me he wants to invest in something else instead, gets like a bit agitated and tries saying an apy and investment are the same thing. We are both yelling/talking with raised voices but neither of us are saying anything rude/derogatory in any way. I\u0027m upset because I feel like he wasn\u0027t including me on those things, like if he found a better account or was looking to \u0022do his own research\u0022 (his words) for an account why wouldn\u0027t he have said so. Anyway during this convo he angrily takes his seatbelt off and starts putting his sneakers on (he was wearing slides) I pull over because I\u0027ve never seen him act like that and I\u0027m like \u0022 what are you gonna get out of my car while it\u0027s moving? like what are you doing?\u0022 He said I was yelling, I\u0027m like you\u0027re yelling and I\u0027m trying to be heard.

Refuses to tell me where his mind is at or what his goal is for the conversation and refuses to provide any reassurance. Is there any fixing this???

Everyone is have talked to says he is overreacting and I should just cut my losses but I\u0026amp;#39;m hoping we can have a productive convo first.

            "selftext": "It might be a bit longer but please bare with me, I could use some outside perspective... thank you!\n\nWe\u0027ve been together for 9 months now, met on Tinder. She\u0027s been all of my firsts (kiss, sex, girlfriend etc). It\u0027s been a rollercoaster. The first few months were amazing but also horrible for me and it was my bad for idolizing her. She wasn\u0027t answering my texts (later admitted she found me needy and annoying, not her type which is usually \u0022bad guy\u0022 but wanted to give us a shot). There were the first 6 months and the last 3-4. During the first few months, she pulled a few really bad moves on me, I\u0027ll give some examples.\n\n* didn\u0027t buy me a birthday gift 4-5 months into our relationship because she didn\u0027t have time to (had to hang out with her roommate because she was going to spend the next 2 nights at my place, what her roomie said). I spent \\~$600 (worth much more in our country) on my birthday weekend with her (activities, restaurants etc). I also went out of my way to get her a thoughtful gift for her birthday (1 month into knowing each other).\n* I got us a small cake with a candle for our 5 month-versary for the fun of it, she shared her half of our cake with her roomate/best friend and asked me if I want mine to go because they wanted to watch a movie\n* She was on a girls\u0027 night out going home, I was also going home and we happened to cross paths. I pulled over to say hi to her, she got very upset for me barging in on her girls\u0027 night (it was just her and her roommate at that point) and I had to apologize\n* She had tinder installed for months, said she installed it to see when we started talking and forgot to delete it despite me seeing many notifications. And quite a few others like this.\n\nThen she told me she loves me, wants a future with me (marriage, kids) and that I\u0027m the greatest thing to ever happen to her and I am the perfect boyfriend. Introduced me to her entire extended family and all of her friends. However, I can\u0027t see any of this \u0022love\u0022. Don\u0027t get me wrong, there are some nice things she\u0027s done (like caring for me when I had a cold) but so few of them. She never bought me a gift or surprised me in any way although I showered her with this stuff (gifts, nights out, parties, flowers, a romantic trip to Paris to a michelin star place, a 2-week vacation, I was regularly spending days planning perfect date nights for us - with surprises, movies, reservations, sweets, flowers, small gifts and thoughtful stuff - never got anything in return). Her plan is to move back to her hometown, a dead-end town in the middle of nowhere, where her family owns a business. I told her I\u0027d go with her and work remotely (also abandoning my current amazing job, family, friends etc) next year. I\u0027m rethinking this.\n\nThere\u0027s this group of girls and guys she hangs out with. All of them being the friend group of her roommate/best friend. They\u0027re all drug addicts and sleep around with everyone, horrible influences. These girls insist on these \u0022girls\u0027\u0022 whatevers (trips, nights out, coffee dates etc). I\u0027m never invited (since they\u0027re all single, there can\u0027t be a non-girls\u0027 night). However, even their last girls\u0027 trip I was specifically uninvited from (because it\u0027s just girls) these other girls had guys over all the time, with my girlfriend also around. She said she wouldn\u0027t have gone if she knew and all that. I tried bringing this up to her, how bad of an influence they are, but she won\u0027t budge. She said she sees this and they don\u0027t influence her. She said this group accepted her when she was lonely and going crazy in a new city and they\u0027re good at heart. But I have doubts. There\u0027s also a very obvious difference in her behavior around them and me - she\u0027s all happy and crazy with me and usually ignores me, or is always half-dead because \u0022we\u0027re always together and have nothing to talk about\u0022. She also doesn\u0027t want to do anything or leave the house (very rarely with me, but when the girls bring it up? Every time).\n\nAnd I also feel like our relationship takes last place. We\u0027re currently living together, with my girlfriend AND her best friend. She said she couldn\u0027t abandon her because of a promise they made the first year of college. In the beginning of our relationship, she also said her friend has a \u0022priority pass\u0022 over me and everyone else. This seems to have changed but as others pointed out, our relationship and future are definitely not top of her list. We\u0027re going to be living together just the two of us because this friend agreed to leave. Otherwise we would\u0027ve been stuck like this. I brought up her friend and also our living situation to her and she seemed devastated, not happy to start a life with me.\n\nAnd lastly, there\u0027s the money. It\u0027s true that I make way more and I also got her used to this, but at one point I was paying for everything except for rent - food, takeout, ciggarettes, going out, drinks. She\u0027s working (slightly above minimum wage) and gets money from her parents, yet I was paying for everything. My paycheck is higher than almost anyone I know (a lot of luck luck and some hard work) yet I end the month with no money or in debt from the next month\u0027s salary. I tried to bring this up to her, she\u0027s empathetic then hours/days later suggests we get sushi, order out, sends me to buy ciggarettes etc. And it all adds up. A ton.\n\nThe problem is she SEEMS like a genuine girl, like a good person, but I\u0027m not fully convinced. She\u0027s very cute to On one hand, I feel like breaking up with her would ruin her future plans and make me feel bad. On the other hand, I still have a licker of hope this relationship just needs me to put more effort in or trust it to go the way I\u0027d like to, although I don\u0027t think so. We\u0027ve been together every day since June so leaving would really hurt? I don\u0027t know how to look at this. What are some signs she\u0027s not in love with me?\n\ntl;dr I don\u0027t feel like my girlfriend loves me, or is just using me for money. I don\u0027t know how to step away, she\u0027s my first everything. Or maybe I\u0027m focusing too much on the negatives and I\u0027m overestimating some things which would otherwise be normal in someone\u0027s life. What are some signs she\u0027s not in love with me?",

She\u0026amp;#39;s been all of my firsts (kiss, sex, girlfriend etc). It\u0026amp;#39;s been a rollercoaster. The first few months were amazing but also horrible for me and it was my bad for idolizing her. She wasn\u0026amp;#39;t answering my texts (later admitted she found me needy and annoying, not her type which is usually \u0026amp;quot;bad guy\u0026amp;quot; but wanted to give us a shot). There were the first 6 months and the last 3-4. During the first few months, she pulled a few really bad moves on me, I\u0026amp;#39;ll give some examples.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;didn\u0026amp;#39;t buy me a birthday gift 4-5 months into our relationship because she didn\u0026amp;#39;t have time to (had to hang out with her roommate because she was going to spend the next 2 nights at my place, what her roomie said). I spent ~$600 (worth much more in our country) on my birthday weekend with her (activities, restaurants etc). I also went out of my way to get her a thoughtful gift for her birthday (1 month into knowing each other).\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;I got us a small cake with a candle for our 5 month-versary for the fun of it, she shared her half of our cake with her roomate/best friend and asked me if I want mine to go because they wanted to watch a movie\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;She was on a girls\u0026amp;#39; night out going home, I was also going home and we happened to cross paths. I pulled over to say hi to her, she got very upset for me barging in on her girls\u0026amp;#39; night (it was just her and her roommate at that point) and I had to apologize\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;She had tinder installed for months, said she installed it to see when we started talking and forgot to delete it despite me seeing many notifications. And quite a few others like this.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Then she told me she loves me, wants a future with me (marriage, kids) and that I\u0026amp;#39;m the greatest thing to ever happen to her and I am the perfect boyfriend. Introduced me to her entire extended family and all of her friends. However, I can\u0026amp;#39;t see any of this \u0026amp;quot;love\u0026amp;quot;. Don\u0026amp;#39;t get me wrong, there are some nice things she\u0026amp;#39;s done (like caring for me when I had a cold) but so few of them. She never bought me a gift or surprised me in any way although I showered her with this stuff (gifts, nights out, parties, flowers, a romantic trip to Paris to a michelin star place, a 2-week vacation, I was regularly spending days planning perfect date nights for us - with surprises, movies, reservations, sweets, flowers, small gifts and thoughtful stuff - never got anything in return). Her plan is to move back to her hometown, a dead-end town in the middle of nowhere, where her family owns a business. I told her I\u0026amp;#39;d go with her and work remotely (also abandoning my current amazing job, family, friends etc) next year. I\u0026amp;#39;m rethinking this.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;There\u0026amp;#39;s this group of girls and guys she hangs out with. All of them being the friend group of her roommate/best friend. They\u0026amp;#39;re all drug addicts and sleep around with everyone, horrible influences. These girls insist on these \u0026amp;quot;girls\u0026amp;#39;\u0026amp;quot; whatevers (trips, nights out, coffee dates etc). I\u0026amp;#39;m never invited (since they\u0026amp;#39;re all single, there can\u0026amp;#39;t be a non-girls\u0026amp;#39; night). However, even their last girls\u0026amp;#39; trip I was specifically uninvited from (because it\u0026amp;#39;s just girls) these other girls had guys over all the time, with my girlfriend also around. She said she wouldn\u0026amp;#39;t have gone if she knew and all that. I tried bringing this up to her, how bad of an influence they are, but she won\u0026amp;#39;t budge. She said she sees this and they don\u0026amp;#39;t influence her. She said this group accepted her when she was lonely and going crazy in a new city and they\u0026amp;#39;re good at heart. But I have doubts. There\u0026amp;#39;s also a very obvious difference in her behavior around them and me - she\u0026amp;#39;s all happy and crazy with me and usually ignores me, or is always half-dead because \u0026amp;quot;we\u0026amp;#39;re always together and have nothing to talk about\u0026amp;quot;. She also doesn\u0026amp;#39;t want to do anything or leave the house (very rarely with me, but when the girls bring it up? Every time).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;And I also feel like our relationship takes last place. We\u0026amp;#39;re currently living together, with my girlfriend AND her best friend. She said she couldn\u0026amp;#39;t abandon her because of a promise they made the first year of college. In the beginning of our relationship, she also said her friend has a \u0026amp;quot;priority pass\u0026amp;quot; over me and everyone else. This seems to have changed but as others pointed out, our relationship and future are definitely not top of her list. We\u0026amp;#39;re going to be living together just the two of us because this friend agreed to leave. Otherwise we would\u0026amp;#39;ve been stuck like this. I brought up her friend and also our living situation to her and she seemed devastated, not happy to start a life with me.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;And lastly, there\u0026amp;#39;s the money. It\u0026amp;#39;s true that I make way more and I also got her used to this, but at one point I was paying for everything except for rent - food, takeout, ciggarettes, going out, drinks. She\u0026amp;#39;s working (slightly above minimum wage) and gets money from her parents, yet I was paying for everything. My paycheck is higher than almost anyone I know (a lot of luck luck and some hard work) yet I end the month with no money or in debt from the next month\u0026amp;#39;s salary. I tried to bring this up to her, she\u0026amp;#39;s empathetic then hours/days later suggests we get sushi, order out, sends me to buy ciggarettes etc. And it all adds up. A ton.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The problem is she SEEMS like a genuine girl, like a good person, but I\u0026amp;#39;m not fully convinced. She\u0026amp;#39;s very cute to On one hand, I feel like breaking up with her would ruin her future plans and make me feel bad. On the other hand, I still have a licker of hope this relationship just needs me to put more effort in or trust it to go the way I\u0026amp;#39;d like to, although I don\u0026amp;#39;t think so. We\u0026amp;#39;ve been together every day since June so leaving would really hurt? I don\u0026amp;#39;t know how to look at this. What are some signs she\u0026amp;#39;s not in love with me?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;tl;dr I don\u0026amp;#39;t feel like my girlfriend loves me, or is just using me for money. I don\u0026amp;#39;t know how to step away, she\u0026amp;#39;s my first everything. Or maybe I\u0026amp;#39;m focusing too much on the negatives and I\u0026amp;#39;m overestimating some things which would otherwise be normal in someone\u0026amp;#39;s life. What are some signs she\u0026amp;#39;s not in love with me?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

I work as the CTO for a start up cloud company.\n\nRecently I\u0027ve felt unhappy in the relationship. With work being as stressful as it is, i\u0027ve always wanted a relationship with as little stress as possible. Recently the stress of the relationship and what feels like has been baby sitting has been just heavy. \n\nFor the first 3 and a half years of the relationship - my gf didn\u0027t have a job which was taxing. She finally got a job at a small mom and pops shop after being pushed but still doesn\u0027t make enough for me to see a future with her. At the time we met she was working as a manager for a store and when we got together she just stopped going. \n\nShe doesn\u0027t have a car and I told her I needed her to get her license which was a mission within itself. \n\nEarlier in the relationship I found out that she wanted to make her own money without working. So she took it upon her self to secretly sell photos of herself online to men who wanted to buy them. They were explicit and she was courting them. When I found out I was hurt but I never processed it. She just agreed to stop \n\nI don\u2019t like that she\u2019s a control freak - she wants my location on \u201Cfind my iphone\u201D on all the time which I can\u2019t stand. If I\u2019m apparently not where I\u2019m supposed to be she gets angry and questions what I\u2019m doing. For an example if I want to go get Starbucks she\u2019s questioning who I\u2019m with. \n\nI wanted to go see family in another country and she became angry that I was going. I told her I wasn\u2019t asking her of going - I\u2019m telling her I was going. She said that I should ask her for her opinion because she would be affected from me leaving. Which I don\u2019t agree \n\nShe currently lives with her parents and what I\u2019ve needed is someone to live with me which both her family and she refuses. Her family refuses because they are Christian. She refuses because if someone is to live with me I need them to contribute evenly to our household. She can\u2019t nor wants to be in a position to do these things. \n\nThe last incident that bothered me was we went to a work event and I\u2019ve spoken to her that what she does and wears at work events is a reflection of me. We went to the most recent and over drank to the point where she throw up I am not kidding around 15 times\u002B 3 of those times were at the event. 4 of those times were on the street waiting for the Uber. When the Uber arrived he refused to take us because she was still throwing up. We had to walk home where she was still throwing up. We get to my house she was throwing up in my guest bathroom and the master bathroom both sink and toilet. The clean up was atrocious. She wasn\u2019t ready to be taken home until the next day 2 pm which resulted in a vocal fight between her father and mother and I. \n\nI tried to break up with her a few weeks ago because she wants kids and I don\u2019t. It was always I didn\u2019t want kids. It wasn\u2019t like one day I changed my mind - but I told her I didn\u2019t want to waste her time but she assured me we\u2019d circle back around it in a year but that\u2019s another year to me wasted. \n\nIt\u2019s hard for because she\u2019s a good person when she wants to be - but I don\u2019t want to baby sit and I don\u2019t want to support someone through life and I feel with her that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. \n\nWill I be better off alone?

I just want to indicate that he\u0027s a 4th year medical intern living in a dormitory with curfew. Me however, already graduated and will take the board exam in a few weeks. We are each other\u0027s first boyfriend and girlfriend. We have been dating for over a year now and has been in LDR for most of our relationship but we are now together since I recently moved back to the same state near his dorm.\n\nFor the past weeks, we have been going through upsets after upsets. These are pretty shallow and not really deep rooted but since the tension has been started, it spirals out of control. We\u0027ll be okay now, then another argument will be opened. My boyfriend is very patient but when he gets tired, he doesn\u0027t know how to handle me.\nMy exams are fast approaching and lately, l\u0027ve been pressured, hence, the upsets. He recently told me that he\u0027s getting burned out. When he gets burned out, he can\u0027t really feel his feelings for me that much. But he always tells me that he loves me and that he wants to fix things with me. I offered him to break up but he refuses to do so because he told me that even when he doesn\u0027t feel the intensity of his love for me that much because he\u0027s tired, he knows that he loves me and that it is only me that he is looking for.\n\nDespite that, it makes me overthink so bad. He also told me that when he thinks of the future, it\u0027s not a 100% clear that I\u0027m in it. He told me that he has the intention of being with me and that he is not playing games but compared to our honeymoon phase and now, he said that he wants to focus on other things and me: His dreams, his family, his future plans but he told me that doesn\u0027t mean that I\u0027m not his priority anymore.\n\nAbout seeing each other, he made it perfectly clear that he wants to see me all the time. It\u0027s the process of walking to me and always beating the curfew that makes him burnt out. He lives in a dormitory that has a curfew by 10 pm and there may be penalties if you go past the curfew. He goes to me everyday and because of the fights lately, he always come home late.\n\nTo be honest, my boyfriend is thoughtful. He updates me all the time. Tells me everything. I\u0027m not worried about cheating because he only ever talks to me and his family. He told me l\u0027m his best friend as well and I could feel that. It\u0027s not always like this too. We are happy with each other too.\nWith all these, he communicated that he wants time to himself. He wants to feel his individuality and want to get things done like do his laundry or just lay on his bed after duty.\n\nI acknowledge that I have my faults too but given that this is my first relationship, l\u0027m having a hard time handling things when it gets hard and he gets tired. I don\u0027t want for us to break up. I want to be better for him too. Please help me what to do. \n\nI also have questions.\n\n1. Is it okay to not see each other everyday?\n2. Do you think he loves me?\n3. Is it normal for couples to be uncertain of each other at times especially when there are upsets?\n4. What are the things do you think I should stop doing to make the relationship better?\n5. Any advice from couples who are in long term relationship because I really want to make this work.\n\nThank you do much for your time and all of the responses will be highly appreciated.",

We get along really well and are super compatible in a lot of really important ways. I\u0027ll also start out by mentioning that sex isn\u0027t a really high priority for me, I can go a long time without it and be perfectly fine. However, I\u0027ve just been feeling odd about thr fact that he seems to only want to receive head. I don\u0027t like receiving head personally, I also like giving him head. But why is that all he wants? Like shit will get steamy, I\u0027ll go down on him, he will finish, then that\u0027s it. I know most people will say \u0022well just ask him\u0022 which yeah I definitely could and he\u0027d be totally chill about it I\u0027m sure, but then I will constantly be wondering if he\u0027s doing something because he feels like he has to after asking about it. We have had sex multiple times, but it\u0027s been about a month if me giving him head every time we see eachother (almost daily) and me receiving nothing. He makes time to see me, is super affectionate and loves when I\u0027m affectionate, talks about things he wants to take me to do, listens and makes efforts when I voice any concerns, he never makes me feel insecure or afraid he doesn\u0027t like me, but it\u0027s is going on with this? Lol \n\nI\u0027d rather just keep giving him head not not receiving anything then be constantly thinking about whether he actually wants to be doing it when we\u0027re doing anything else. I\u0027m hoping maybe someone else has had a similar experience maybe? I don\u0027t know. I lost a ton of weight before him and I met and feel like I look the best I have since high school, so it\u0027s like a super weird feeling when I feel like my boyfriend should want to fuck me but he doesn\u0027t.

He is unlike anyone I\u0026amp;#39;ve ever dated or even met really. We get along really well and are super compatible in a lot of really important ways. I\u0026amp;#39;ll also start out by mentioning that sex isn\u0026amp;#39;t a really high priority for me, I can go a long time without it and be perfectly fine. However, I\u0026amp;#39;ve just been feeling odd about thr fact that he seems to only want to receive head. I don\u0026amp;#39;t like receiving head personally, I also like giving him head. But why is that all he wants? Like shit will get steamy, I\u0026amp;#39;ll go down on him, he will finish, then that\u0026amp;#39;s it. I know most people will say \u0026amp;quot;well just ask him\u0026amp;quot; which yeah I definitely could and he\u0026amp;#39;d be totally chill about it I\u0026amp;#39;m sure, but then I will constantly be wondering if he\u0026amp;#39;s doing something because he feels like he has to after asking about it. We have had sex multiple times, but it\u0026amp;#39;s been about a month if me giving him head every time we see eachother (almost daily) and me receiving nothing. He makes time to see me, is super affectionate and loves when I\u0026amp;#39;m affectionate, talks about things he wants to take me to do, listens and makes efforts when I voice any concerns, he never makes me feel insecure or afraid he doesn\u0026amp;#39;t like me, but it\u0026amp;#39;s is going on with this? Lol \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I\u0026amp;#39;d rather just keep giving him head not not receiving anything then be constantly thinking about whether he actually wants to be doing it when we\u0026amp;#39;re doing anything else. I\u0026amp;#39;m hoping maybe someone else has had a similar experience maybe? I don\u0026amp;#39;t know. I lost a ton of weight before him and I met and feel like I look the best I have since high school, so it\u0026amp;#39;s like a super weird feeling when I feel like my boyfriend should want to fuck me but he doesn\u0026amp;#39;t. Lol \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

Me (24F) and my BF (22M) have been together for 4 years and we are long distance. Pretty soon after we first started dating, his dad showed his true colors as an ungrateful, financially unstable, sleezy man who I wanted to keep at a distance. His parents are divorced and he spent a lot of time with his dad in his teenage years and my boyfriend was young and probably didn\u2019t want to believe his father wasn\u2019t the hero he thought he was and so I was hoping he\u2019d eventually grow out of this. Fast forward a couple years and his father has put him in thousands of dollars of credit card debt behind his back and will spend money he doesn\u2019t have when he owes people (short summary of all the things this man has done that I know of). I recently loaned my boyfriend a couple thousand dollars to help pay for his career (a complicated situation that takes a lot of upfront investment and the returns come later on) and he hasn\u2019t been able to pay me back half a year later because he has to pay off his father\u2019s debts and his dad is being so slow about paying him back. I told him it\u2019s okay if he prioritizes the credit card balances since they\u2019re accumulating interest and that\u2019s only going to harm our future together with low credit scores. My BF currently lives overseas and can\u2019t afford to visit me and I decided it wasn\u2019t logical for me to spend money on visiting him when he owes me so much. Frankly, if his dad just paid back all the debt to him everything would be solved but nope- his dad is planning an expensive trip to visit him meanwhile I don\u2019t get to see my boyfriend because of a financial situation his father caused. It frustrates me that my boyfriend is okay with this; in an ideal world he would tell his dad that he shouldn\u2019t visit until his debts are paid since our relationship is being affected by the situation at hand. I\u2019ve communicated that it upsets me that I can\u2019t visit him because of a financial situation that isn\u2019t necessarily our fault but that was before I found out his dad is visiting. Unfortunately, there\u2019s not much my boyfriend can do in the position he\u2019s in to pay off these debts more than he already is, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the situation with his dad (but who knows what that man does with his income).\n\nI\u2019m afraid of bringing it up to my boyfriend because I\u2019m sure he\u2019s happy about the idea of somebody visiting him out there and if it were anyone else I\u2019d be happy for him too. But I can\u2019t help but feel like it\u2019s a \u201Cfuck you\u201D for me to not be able to see my long distance boyfriend that I barely see already while the man who\u2019s fault it is gets to. I want to regret loaning my boyfriend that money but I know I did it out of the kindness in my heart and I want to have a dependable teamwork relationship when hardships come up. Idk what to do because every time I think about this, my blood boils. I\u2019m in the position of just coping with the shitty situation and trying to sympathize that my boyfriend has a sub-par father and he might have trouble dealing with that. I\u2019d like to talk to my BF\u2019s mother or his aunt (dad\u2019s sister in law) who I know also don\u2019t like his father to console with somebody who knows him personally but that might be sticky so not sure.\n\nAny advice or analysis of the situation would be appreciated. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s worth saying anything again or just letting it run its course (I\u2019ve already distanced his dad and plan on keeping him as small of a part of my life as possible). I don\u2019t want to ruin his excitement to have his dad visit but I\u2019m surprised he\u2019s okay with it after everything.\n\nI wish I had a therapist to unravel this whole situation with in depth but for now I greatly appreciate all of you that respond.",

I\u0027ve been with my boyfriend for just over 3 years now (both 21) and we live together in a 2 bed flat (we have our own rooms). I\u0027ve been noticing my feelings fade for him for a while now (about a year). We rarely have sex and I don\u0027t know if i\u0027m having fun anymore. He treats me kind of like his mom. I do his laundry, most (if not all) of the cooking and cleaning and have to remind him to do simple things constantly and we\u0027ve fought about this many times (the only real fight we have). On top of this, he\u0027s become a different person since we got together. He used to go to the gym 5 days a week, eat healthy and excel in his work. I thought he may be experiencing depression or something and i\u0027ve tried to talk to him about it various times but he always says he\u0027s ok.\u00A0  \n  \nWe broke up the day after our 3 year anniversary for 4 days. I initiated the break up and told him we both needed to get back on track for me with my career (I graduated last year) and him with uni. He did not take this well unsurprisingly and iced me out for the whole time. He came in my room on the evening of the 4th day and asked to get back together. I was in a very low mood that day and said yes.\u00A0  \n  \nWe\u0027ve been back together for about 2 weeks I don\u0027t think I made the right choice. He seemed to do a 180 over those 4 days. He started going to the gym, making food and doing laundry. Since we\u0027ve been back together he\u0027s reverted straight back almost. In the beginning, we would go to the gym together and make healthy meals. but somehow now he\u0027s behind on his uni work and hasn\u0027t been to the gym in 5 days. It makes me feel like im the distraction in his life. I try to motivate him to do things but he\u0027s always playing on his xbox or making excuses.\u00A0  \n  \nwhat do I do...",

I\u0026amp;#39;ve been with my boyfriend for just over 3 years now (both 21) and we live together in a 2 bed flat (we have our own rooms). I\u0026amp;#39;ve been noticing my feelings fade for him for a while now (about a year). We rarely have sex and I don\u0026amp;#39;t know if i\u0026amp;#39;m having fun anymore. He treats me kind of like his mom. I do his laundry, most (if not all) of the cooking and cleaning and have to remind him to do simple things constantly and we\u0026amp;#39;ve fought about this many times (the only real fight we have). On top of this, he\u0026amp;#39;s become a different person since we got together. He used to go to the gym 5 days a week, eat healthy and excel in his work. I thought he may be experiencing depression or something and i\u0026amp;#39;ve tried to talk to him about it various times but he always says he\u0026amp;#39;s ok.\u00A0  \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We broke up the day after our 3 year anniversary for 4 days. I initiated the break up and told him we both needed to get back on track for me with my career (I graduated last year) and him with uni. He did not take this well unsurprisingly and iced me out for the whole time. He came in my room on the evening of the 4th day and asked to get back together. I was in a very low mood that day and said yes.\u00A0  \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We\u0026amp;#39;ve been back together for about 2 weeks I don\u0026amp;#39;t think I made the right choice. He seemed to do a 180 over those 4 days. He started going to the gym, making food and doing laundry. Since we\u0026amp;#39;ve been back together he\u0026amp;#39;s reverted straight back almost. In the beginning, we would go to the gym together and make healthy meals. but somehow now he\u0026amp;#39;s behind on his uni work and hasn\u0026amp;#39;t been to the gym in 5 days. It makes me feel like im the distraction in his life. I try to motivate him to do things but he\u0026amp;#39;s always playing on his xbox or making excuses.\u00A0  \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;what do I do...\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

It starts somewhere in the 90\u2019s when he married my first step-mom and I became an afterthought. My mother and I were hit by a drunk driver in \u201898 and while I was relearning how to walk, my father came to the hospital and made my mother give him the hat I was wearing in the crash because it belonged to my stepbrother. She cheated on him in \u201899 and they divorced. He married my second and now stepmom a few years later, she came into it with two sons many years younger than me I\u2019ll call Richard and Louis IX, and a sister born several years later I\u2019ll call Elizabeth. Since then, I\u2019ve been treated as the other son at every opportunity. It started small with stuff I can\u2019t complain about like different efforts put into his kids birthdays and going to a few of my games a year vs all of my brothers. At 18 I joined the army and we didn\u2019t have a ton of contact until I got out at 23. I will admit that he did try to have some relationship with me during the next few years but it wasn\u2019t much. I didn\u2019t really put any thought into it until a couple years ago when he asked me to stay at his house and watch his dogs while he was out of town for a week. I didn\u2019t find out until after they\u2019d left that his brother in law was taking the entire family to Disney World and he\u2019d lied because he \u201Cknew I\u2019d be upset\u201D. After that we didn\u2019t talk for about half a year until he started texting me like nothing happened. Since then I\u2019ve had time to think back on the last almost 30 years and realize how I was never even on his list of priorities. All of his other kids live with him/in his properties, with two of them not having jobs or licenses despite being in their 20\u2019s. This all came to a head last night when my mom sent me a picture from my brothers Facebook page and asked me if I\u2019d known he got married. It turns out Richard had a big wedding 7 months ago, and nobody had bothered to invite me let alone tell me it was happening. At this point I don\u2019t even feel any emotion towards the situation and would prefer to just not answer his rare calls. I\u2019ve talked it over with my mom several times over the past few years and while she understands why I feel the way I do and understands what I want, she thinks I should take it for what it is and accept that while it\u2019s not a good relationship I should still talk to him. We\u2019ve gone back and forth and I want to know what strangers on the internet think. Any advice would be appreciated.\n ",

It starts somewhere in the 90\u2019s when he married my first step-mom and I became an afterthought. My mother and I were hit by a drunk driver in \u201898 and while I was relearning how to walk, my father came to the hospital and made my mother give him the hat I was wearing in the crash because it belonged to my stepbrother. She cheated on him in \u201899 and they divorced. He married my second and now stepmom a few years later, she came into it with two sons many years younger than me I\u2019ll call Richard and Louis IX, and a sister born several years later I\u2019ll call Elizabeth. Since then, I\u2019ve been treated as the other son at every opportunity. It started small with stuff I can\u2019t complain about like different efforts put into his kids birthdays and going to a few of my games a year vs all of my brothers. At 18 I joined the army and we didn\u2019t have a ton of contact until I got out at 23. I will admit that he did try to have some relationship with me during the next few years but it wasn\u2019t much. I didn\u2019t really put any thought into it until a couple years ago when he asked me to stay at his house and watch his dogs while he was out of town for a week. I didn\u2019t find out until after they\u2019d left that his brother in law was taking the entire family to Disney World and he\u2019d lied because he \u201Cknew I\u2019d be upset\u201D. After that we didn\u2019t talk for about half a year until he started texting me like nothing happened. Since then I\u2019ve had time to think back on the last almost 30 years and realize how I was never even on his list of priorities. All of his other kids live with him/in his properties, with two of them not having jobs or licenses despite being in their 20\u2019s. This all came to a head last night when my mom sent me a picture from my brothers Facebook page and asked me if I\u2019d known he got married. It turns out Richard had a big wedding 7 months ago, and nobody had bothered to invite me let alone tell me it was happening. At this point I don\u2019t even feel any emotion towards the situation and would prefer to just not answer his rare calls. I\u2019ve talked it over with my mom several times over the past few years and while she understands why I feel the way I do and understands what I want, she thinks I should take it for what it is and accept that while it\u2019s not a good relationship I should still talk to him. We\u2019ve gone back and forth and I want to know what strangers on the internet think. Any advice would be appreciated.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

Yes, I\u0027d lost my paternal grandmother a year or so prior, and would end up losing my paternal grandfather later in 2021, but I was never that close with them. My uncle was like a second dad to me and was just that kind of person everyone liked and was impossible to dislike. \n\nAnyway, a while after his passing, my aunt became basically a shut-in. She stopped working and just spent all her time at home in her house, with my cousin still living with her. But as time went on, she also started to become more and more unlike herself, as it were. She became more dependent on my cousin (and his sister) for even basic things like groceries, because she would not get in a car to drive herself. Not even to see her mother who was just down the road. Everything she needed, she asked my cousin to get for her. And they would continually fight and bicker, even in the presence of other people like me, my parents or even full house guests. \n\nAnd eventually, my dad, in I guess an attempt to get her out of the house more often, would invite her to dinner on Fridays with him and my mom. That\u0027s been a pretty regular thing, much to my mother\u0027s silent disapproval. I mention this because, as she vented to me, she never really has liked my aunt to begin with. According to her, my uncle basically just took care of all her needs and wants and \u0022pampered her\u0022. \u0022That\u0027s what really killed him\u0022, she urged to me. That he literally pushed himself to the limit trying to always manage/take care of my aunt. \n\nNow, I don\u0027t know if she\u0027s just exaggerating, but I also don\u0027t have any reason to think my mom would lie since she\u0027s never lied to me about anything. But here\u0027s what I do know: my aunt is not well, yet at the same time she doesn\u0027t seem to have the inclination to want to help herself at some point. My cousin (her daughter) tried getting her to see a therapist or two, but she refused. And this past weekend, we had a birthday party for my cousin (the one still living with her) and her friends from out of town came to visit. But, instead of staying with her at her house, she wanted all of them to stay at my cousin\u0027s house, which caused some frustration that she (my cousin) told me about. \n\nThat\u0027s the best way I can sum up this situation. I feel like I should do something, but the other half of me wants to just walk away and not deal with it. I just don\u0027t know if that\u0027s the right move. \n\nTL;DR - aunt is mentally unwell after my uncle\u0027s passing and is causing frustrations between various family members that could one day come to a head.",

            "selftext": "So this past month has been super hard on the relationship. My gf has had finals and the classes she\u0027s taking were really hard. This month we haven\u0027t gone in a single date, she hasn\u0027t bought me flowers, she hasn\u0027t been as romantic, and our intimate life has gone way down hill. This is really unusual for her. She usually constantly surprises me with gifts, dates, and we had a really flourishing intimate life. I chalked it up to just stress from school but now I\u0027m getting really suspicious. My gf has a new work friend, they got really close really fast. It started at the beginning of the month too. They even went to study at the college together with another friend. My gf works at Starbucks and when we were going to go on our first date in a month we decided to get coffee. Well this friend was the one who gave us the drinks. She sarted saying things like \u0022Is that my pookie? Where are you going? I\u0027m gonna miss you I wish I could come with you! I\u0027ll see you soon! I\u0027ll miss you so much\u0022 in front of me in a baby pouting voice. She completely ignored me and didn\u0027t even look at me. I even told her to have a good day and she just brushed it off. She also knows I\u0027m my partner\u0027s gf. My gf didn\u0027t see anything wrong with it when I brought up I was uncomfortable. She played it off as \u0022Oh I\u0027m sure she talks to everyone like that\u0022. \nI was really uncomfortable and so I decided to look at my gf\u0027s discord. I know it\u0027s wrong and I feel bad but I didn\u0027t want to immediately jump to jealousy and make my gf not want to make new friends. I knew I wasn\u0027t going to find anything but I\u0027ve been cheated on before and seeing with my own eyes that it\u0027s just my delusions makes it so much better. But... I found out she\u0027s been chatting with a girl on there for an entire month. Completely different girl. My gf hasn\u0027t said a single thing to me about this new friend but looking at their chats they seem to be \u0022super close friends\u0022. My gf tells me everything but she for some reason kept having a \u0022super close\u0022 friend from me? 99% of their conversation was talking about how amazing it was they both were gay and the girl comparing my gf to one of her fictional crushes. \nI\u0027m starting to wonder if my gf pulled so far away from me because rn she\u0027s busy giving attention to other women... I know I have some trust issues and trauma with being cheated on. I\u0027m trying to work on it. That\u0027s why I want to know if I\u0027m just being overly jealous and need to apologize to her or if this actually suspicious behavior and we need to have a serious discussion \n\nTDLR: My gf has been slightly neglectful towards our relationship. I chalked it up to her being stressed about school. Found out her coworker was being slightly flirty and my gf was having conversations about how amazing it is she and an online friend she\u0027s never told me about are both gay. I want to know if I\u0027m being overly jealous or if this is weird behavior",

My gf has had finals and the classes she\u0026amp;#39;s taking were really hard. This month we haven\u0026amp;#39;t gone in a single date, she hasn\u0026amp;#39;t bought me flowers, she hasn\u0026amp;#39;t been as romantic, and our intimate life has gone way down hill. This is really unusual for her. She usually constantly surprises me with gifts, dates, and we had a really flourishing intimate life. I chalked it up to just stress from school but now I\u0026amp;#39;m getting really suspicious. My gf has a new work friend, they got really close really fast. It started at the beginning of the month too. They even went to study at the college together with another friend. My gf works at Starbucks and when we were going to go on our first date in a month we decided to get coffee. Well this friend was the one who gave us the drinks. She sarted saying things like \u0026amp;quot;Is that my pookie? Where are you going? I\u0026amp;#39;m gonna miss you I wish I could come with you! I\u0026amp;#39;ll see you soon! I\u0026amp;#39;ll miss you so much\u0026amp;quot; in front of me in a baby pouting voice. She completely ignored me and didn\u0026amp;#39;t even look at me. I even told her to have a good day and she just brushed it off. She also knows I\u0026amp;#39;m my partner\u0026amp;#39;s gf. My gf didn\u0026amp;#39;t see anything wrong with it when I brought up I was uncomfortable. She played it off as \u0026amp;quot;Oh I\u0026amp;#39;m sure she talks to everyone like that\u0026amp;quot;. \nI was really uncomfortable and so I decided to look at my gf\u0026amp;#39;s discord. I know it\u0026amp;#39;s wrong and I feel bad but I didn\u0026amp;#39;t want to immediately jump to jealousy and make my gf not want to make new friends. I knew I wasn\u0026amp;#39;t going to find anything but I\u0026amp;#39;ve been cheated on before and seeing with my own eyes that it\u0026amp;#39;s just my delusions makes it so much better. But... I found out she\u0026amp;#39;s been chatting with a girl on there for an entire month. Completely different girl. My gf hasn\u0026amp;#39;t said a single thing to me about this new friend but looking at their chats they seem to be \u0026amp;quot;super close friends\u0026amp;quot;. My gf tells me everything but she for some reason kept having a \u0026amp;quot;super close\u0026amp;quot; friend from me? 99% of their conversation was talking about how amazing it was they both were gay and the girl comparing my gf to one of her fictional crushes. \nI\u0026amp;#39;m starting to wonder if my gf pulled so far away from me because rn she\u0026amp;#39;s busy giving attention to other women... I know I have some trust issues and trauma with being cheated on. I\u0026amp;#39;m trying to work on it. That\u0026amp;#39;s why I want to know if I\u0026amp;#39;m just being overly jealous and need to apologize to her or if this actually suspicious behavior and we need to have a serious discussion \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;TDLR: My gf has been slightly neglectful towards our relationship. I chalked it up to her being stressed about school. Found out her coworker was being slightly flirty and my gf was having conversations about how amazing it is she and an online friend she\u0026amp;#39;s never told me about are both gay. I want to know if I\u0026amp;#39;m being overly jealous or if this is weird behavior\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

We\u2019ve always had a loving relationship\u2014he\u2019s kind, generous, caring, and when we\u2019re together, we\u2019re inseparable. We know each other\u2019s phone passwords, share locations, and have an open and honest relationship.\n\nThe issue is, we only see each other on weekends because he works in the office during the week and we live about 40 minutes apart. On Saturdays, he plays sports, and by the time he\u2019s finished, it\u2019s around 6pm. After that, he usually hangs out at the sports club with his friends and goes to the pub. His job also involves a lot of client meetups, so he\u2019s often out drinking on Weds,Thursdays/Fridays, sometimes coming home as late as 1-3 am. During these nights out, he never calls or his texts are sparse.\n\nI\u2019ve told him multiple times that I don\u2019t feel like a priority because of this, but he insists that he has a life outside of the relationship and doesn\u2019t want to change his social habits. He says that being social is important and that I need to understand that. This leaves me feeling sad, like maybe if I had a closer group of friends or enjoyed going out as much as he does, I wouldn\u2019t feel so lonely.\n\nMost Sundays when I see him, he\u2019s either hungover and wants to stay in bed or we\u2019re attending some family obligation of his. Over the years, he\u2019s gone on multiple boys\u0027 trips\u2014Ibiza (x2), Miami, golf trips, and now he\u2019s just booked a 2-week trip to Thailand with his single friends. I can\u2019t help but feel like he\u2019s more excited about these trips with his friends than any of our time together. We do go on holidays, but it feels like he\u2019s only going because he has to, while he\u2019s super excited for his boys\u0027 trips.\n\nWhenever it\u2019s just the two of us, he wants to go to bed early, but with his friends, he\u2019s out until the early hours of the morning. When I try to express how much this bothers me, he gets defensive and says I\u2019m nagging at him and all I do is \u0022roast him\u0022, which makes me feel guilty for even bringing it up.\n\nRecently, I went on his iPad and saw he\u2019s been exchanging cheating-related memes on TikTok with his friends. When I confronted him, he said it\u2019s just dark humour and doesn\u2019t mean anything. Everything else on his phone is fine.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t physically done anything to make me walk away, but I\u2019m torn. Am I asking for too much? Should I focus on improving my own life so our relationship can be healthier, or are my feelings valid?",

We\u2019ve always had a loving relationship\u2014he\u2019s kind, generous, caring, and when we\u2019re together, we\u2019re inseparable. We know each other\u2019s phone passwords, share locations, and have an open and honest relationship.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The issue is, we only see each other on weekends because he works in the office during the week and we live about 40 minutes apart. On Saturdays, he plays sports, and by the time he\u2019s finished, it\u2019s around 6pm. After that, he usually hangs out at the sports club with his friends and goes to the pub. His job also involves a lot of client meetups, so he\u2019s often out drinking on Weds,Thursdays/Fridays, sometimes coming home as late as 1-3 am. During these nights out, he never calls or his texts are sparse.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I\u2019ve told him multiple times that I don\u2019t feel like a priority because of this, but he insists that he has a life outside of the relationship and doesn\u2019t want to change his social habits. He says that being social is important and that I need to understand that. This leaves me feeling sad, like maybe if I had a closer group of friends or enjoyed going out as much as he does, I wouldn\u2019t feel so lonely.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Most Sundays when I see him, he\u2019s either hungover and wants to stay in bed or we\u2019re attending some family obligation of his. Over the years, he\u2019s gone on multiple boys\u0026amp;#39; trips\u2014Ibiza (x2), Miami, golf trips, and now he\u2019s just booked a 2-week trip to Thailand with his single friends. I can\u2019t help but feel like he\u2019s more excited about these trips with his friends than any of our time together. We do go on holidays, but it feels like he\u2019s only going because he has to, while he\u2019s super excited for his boys\u0026amp;#39; trips.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Whenever it\u2019s just the two of us, he wants to go to bed early, but with his friends, he\u2019s out until the early hours of the morning. When I try to express how much this bothers me, he gets defensive and says I\u2019m nagging at him and all I do is \u0026amp;quot;roast him\u0026amp;quot;, which makes me feel guilty for even bringing it up.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Recently, I went on his iPad and saw he\u2019s been exchanging cheating-related memes on TikTok with his friends. When I confronted him, he said it\u2019s just dark humour and doesn\u2019t mean anything. Everything else on his phone is fine.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;He hasn\u2019t physically done anything to make me walk away, but I\u2019m torn. Am I asking for too much? Should I focus on improving my own life so our relationship can be healthier, or are my feelings valid?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

I start many fights because of their actions, which I feel go against what I see as acceptable and my expectations for a partner. We recently started a long-distance relationship since I moved away two months ago. I felt as though it was going fine, with a few issues of poor communication on their part, which have been sorted out (I think). Another reason I feel my resentment and anger growing is that they\u2019re not meeting my expectations of what I need in a partner. They tend to lack motivation, self-discipline, and have an opposite lifestyle to mine (alcohol, nicotine, weed).\n\nWe\u2019ve had long talks recently since I\u2019ve been in their town for a week now. We had many arguments, but we also sat down a few times for hours to talk about what\u2019s going on and my behavior toward them. I told them I\u2019m running out of patience and feel like I\u2019m building resentment toward them. I\u2019m confused about why I feel this way\u2014maybe it\u2019s because of the long distance or not having the ability to be around friends and my partner. I know it\u2019s unfair, and I hold myself accountable for my own actions and faults. I\u2019ve been reflecting and debating whether this relationship is worth continuing. I do love them and hope for a future together, but the arguing makes me wonder if we\u2019d be better off apart. I\u2019ve also been thinking about taking a break when I return to my town, especially since we\u2019re attending a family event later this week. I don\u2019t know anymore, and I\u2019m wondering: What steps can I take to figure out whether a break or breakup is the best way forward? How can I decide what\u2019s healthiest for both of us in the long run?\n\nTL;DR: I (22F) have been dating my partner (21M) for 4 months, but I\u2019ve been building resentment and starting fights. We recently went long-distance, and I feel frustrated by their lifestyle and behavior. After several arguments, I\u2019m questioning if we should take a break or end the relationship entirely. I love them but am unsure how to move forward. What steps can I take to figure out the best decision?",

I have recently felt as though I\u2019ve been building resentment toward them and am always angry at them. I start many fights because of their actions, which I feel go against what I see as acceptable and my expectations for a partner. We recently started a long-distance relationship since I moved away two months ago. I felt as though it was going fine, with a few issues of poor communication on their part, which have been sorted out (I think). Another reason I feel my resentment and anger growing is that they\u2019re not meeting my expectations of what I need in a partner. They tend to lack motivation, self-discipline, and have an opposite lifestyle to mine (alcohol, nicotine, weed).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We\u2019ve had long talks recently since I\u2019ve been in their town for a week now. We had many arguments, but we also sat down a few times for hours to talk about what\u2019s going on and my behavior toward them. I told them I\u2019m running out of patience and feel like I\u2019m building resentment toward them. I\u2019m confused about why I feel this way\u2014maybe it\u2019s because of the long distance or not having the ability to be around friends and my partner. I know it\u2019s unfair, and I hold myself accountable for my own actions and faults. I\u2019ve been reflecting and debating whether this relationship is worth continuing. I do love them and hope for a future together, but the arguing makes me wonder if we\u2019d be better off apart. I\u2019ve also been thinking about taking a break when I return to my town, especially since we\u2019re attending a family event later this week. I don\u2019t know anymore, and I\u2019m wondering: What steps can I take to figure out whether a break or breakup is the best way forward? How can I decide what\u2019s healthiest for both of us in the long run?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;TL;DR: I (22F) have been dating my partner (21M) for 4 months, but I\u2019ve been building resentment and starting fights. We recently went long-distance, and I feel frustrated by their lifestyle and behavior. After several arguments, I\u2019m questioning if we should take a break or end the relationship entirely. I love them but am unsure how to move forward. What steps can I take to figure out the best decision?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

I hardly see him, his errands gym friends and family come first. He said he wants to work out and get his body as big as possible. He\u2019s happy to constantly go to take time away from us. He said \u201Cwell I can free up abit more time\u201D and I said- \u201Cabit more time? We don\u2019t get anytime now\u201D he clearly thinks we get enough time.. sleeping next to eachother is enough. It\u2019s pointless to have a relationship like this.\n\nHe said he wants to own his business (which is fine) \nI find today he wants a big house somewhere hot with loads of cars. He said he doesn\u2019t care where it is. I got upset and was baffled with the sudden change of his future, And I said what about our plans we had? They are completely opposite, and he said \u201Cwhat\u2019s the big deal why are you upset about that it\u2019s pathetic\u201D and he said fine we will get a big house  in the country.. I felt like he only said this to shut me up, without a care in the world, and told me I\u2019m childish and to leave him alone? Because I did get really upset that the future I thought I had with someone had changed? It hurts.. and I\u2019m just baffled by it. He thinks it\u2019s not a big deal, he\u2019s just changed these plans without a second thought? Like it\u2019s nothing?\n\nHe came home after the phone call and pretended like nothing had happened.. \u201Cdo you want to cuddle before I go back out\u201D I don\u2019t understand this?  Is he mocking me? He\u2019s pretending I\u2019m not upset ignoring it?\n\nI love him but I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s still with me if he clearly doesn\u2019t care. He has places to go people to see, places to stay, he works, he avoids conversations and expects me to live in the shadows of his life rather then share a life together, and I get bread crumbs of his time. He also stated that I bring nothing to the table. He\u2019s absolutely my world and he comes first before anything I\u2019m giving him my life and he\u2019s giving me hardly anything back. So why does he stick around? Or come here to sleep? I don\u2019t understand really. I only see him to sleep or really late at night. I don\u2019t want to end things but I\u2019m really confused. \n\nHe really doesn\u2019t see why I\u2019m upset and it\u2019s frustrating! He\u2019s now gone to have his kids for the weekend and I\u2019m left at home just stuck thinking about all this..\n\nWhat can I do at this point? What are my options? I can\u2019t force someone to treat me better or want the same things he\u2019s changed and I don\u2019t know what to do.\n",

I try to phrase it in a way that is not controlling. I don\u0027t want to tell her what to do or who she hangs out with, i just really wish for some more communication/updates on her part about changes in plans. She responds apologetically by saying that she did not mean to leave me in the dark and miscommunicate, but refuses to elaborate further. So i go back to giving her some space.\n\nIt\u0027s now 9:30pm ish. She didn\u0027t message me or call to update me on her return time. So I reach out to her and she picks up and lets me know she\u0027s coming home at midnight instead.

            "selftext": "So my (20F) bf (22M) have been together for a year and a half now. Near the beginning of our relationship we talked about our boundaries and I had said that I wouldn\u2019t like him to be watching porn and he said the same for me. We both agreed on it and had no other problems. He even said things that made it seem like he wanted to stop watching it for my sake because he wants to wait for me (when we see each other because we dont hangout everyday) and not have to take relieve himself on his own time. Now I understand humans, we get horny and you relieve it somehow. It\u2019s just that he made it seem like he didn\u2019t have any problem waiting for the days we hangout to do stuff.\n\nA few months ago, my fyp was flooded with tiktoks about women finding porn in their bf\u2019s reddit history and saved posts. I mentioned this to my bf and he even said \u201Cya those bf\u2019s are not good\u201D. I then proceeded to ask if i could see his saved posts. Well there it was two posts saved about girls giving bjs. I was shocked. He told me he had these saved from before we were dating which I get. Although one of them i noticed, were posted while we were in a relationship so he saved it when we were together. I brought this up and he didn\u2019t really know what to say and just apologized. He said he would stop. Long story short he still has them saved idk if he watches them or not. \n\nAnyways, a few months ago he started playing that nikke game. The game\u2019s characters are anime women with extremely exaggerated body proportions and wearing revealing clothes. I\u2019m a 5\u20193 girl, skinny and petite with not much hips or bust. He showed me the game and immediately i felt uncomfortable and he could tell. I tried to be understanding of it but I didnt like thinking about it. After some time i told him he can play but just stop showing me the characters and game play because it makes me uncomfortable. I just don\u2019t want to be controlling and ever tell him he can\u2019t play a game because of me being uncomfortable. Currently, he told me he stopped playing the game but he still has the app on his phone. Whether he plays or not idk. \n\nI know my boyfriend likes bigs boobs but he has always tried to make me feel confident. However sometimes he makes comments like \u201Coh when you breastfeed your boobs will be bigger right?\u201D He also likes kpop idols who have big chests. The other day he was laying on my chest and i said it hurt a bit and he asked \u201Cif your boobs were bigger, would it not hurt if i lay on your chest?\u201D Then he said he was just wondering. It\u2019s just small comments like that that remind me that he prefers bigger boobs. \n\nJust today, i was using his phone browser (it\u2019s called brave i think) and i went into the history because i forgot the link i had just looked up a little bit ago. That\u2019s when i found all the history of hentai he reads and even some porn he watches. I clicked on one and the link showed me the hentai with women with huge busts ofc. Then the porn he watched had \u201Cbig tits\u201D in the title. I know i can\u2019t stop him from watching or reading this stuff but it just hurts that he does and lies to me about it. And i can\u2019t help but to feel not enough for inadequate because my body is nothing like these women he likes. Obviously i know these hentai anime characters are not real and portray unrealistic bodies but i\u2019m still nowhere close to having big boobs. How can I learn to be okay with this and not let it affect me?",

She came up to me on the last day of class of the spring semester. I didn\u0027t even see her when she first flagged me down, which looking back makes me feel a little shitty. But one of my friends got my attention and me and her walked into a side room to talk, because the hall was so loud.\n\nIt was a little hard to understand her because she has a thick accent and I\u0027m hard of hearing. Once I finally got it, I said no at first because I like to know someone a little longer first and I had just gotten out of a pretty bad relationship, but I agreed to be friends and to see where it goes from there.\n\nA month in she called me her boyfriend, even though we hadn\u0027t talked about it before. But it was pretty great from there minus the 12 hour time difference.\n\nNow what happened next was not planned, but she got put in my apartment by the university as I have an on campus apartment with a friend and there was a couple rooms open.\n\nThe problem is that since moving in, I just don\u0027t feel the spark. She\u0027s also very touchy, which I can be to, but for some reason she really likes my stomach which I have body image issues with(I\u0027m in therapy for don\u0027t jump my ass). I just feel that we aren\u0027t the right people for each other and I feel really guilty about this.\n\nI know I should if I am feeling like this, I just don\u0027t want to make things weird in the apartment.\n\nTLDR; I think I need to breakup with my girlfriend, because I think were better friends, but we live together for the next year and don\u0027t want to make it weird in the apartment.",

She came up to me on the last day of class of the spring semester. I didn\u0026amp;#39;t even see her when she first flagged me down, which looking back makes me feel a little shitty. But one of my friends got my attention and me and her walked into a side room to talk, because the hall was so loud.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;It was a little hard to understand her because she has a thick accent and I\u0026amp;#39;m hard of hearing. Once I finally got it, I said no at first because I like to know someone a little longer first and I had just gotten out of a pretty bad relationship, but I agreed to be friends and to see where it goes from there.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A month in she called me her boyfriend, even though we hadn\u0026amp;#39;t talked about it before. But it was pretty great from there minus the 12 hour time difference.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Now what happened next was not planned, but she got put in my apartment by the university as I have an on campus apartment with a friend and there was a couple rooms open.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The problem is that since moving in, I just don\u0026amp;#39;t feel the spark. She\u0026amp;#39;s also very touchy, which I can be to, but for some reason she really likes my stomach which I have body image issues with(I\u0026amp;#39;m in therapy for don\u0026amp;#39;t jump my ass). I just feel that we aren\u0026amp;#39;t the right people for each other and I feel really guilty about this.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I know I should if I am feeling like this, I just don\u0026amp;#39;t want to make things weird in the apartment.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;TLDR; I think I need to breakup with my girlfriend, because I think were better friends, but we live together for the next year and don\u0026amp;#39;t want to make it weird in the apartment.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

However, when we started talking I was on a train going from one side of America all the way to the other on September 7th , my train ended up delayed for a good 2\u002B hours and we got talking in a call together. We ended up getting together officially the 14th of September. There\u0027s no way to describe how I felt on that train trip other than that years were passing me by. It felt as though I was on it for 3 years as opposed to it being a 3 day trip to and back. Everything felt as though it was going how it should, however now that I am back home it feels as though we went way too quick too fast. We have only known of eachothers existence since August and we\u0027re already saying \u0022I love you\u0022 and talking about marriage. \n\nKeep in mind this is an online relationship, he lives in the UK and I live in the US. I have a script of what I want to say to him, but seeing as he\u0027s an extreme overthinker I\u0027m not sure if I phrased things properly to not come off as toxic or anything. This is what I have prepared to say to him:\n\n\u0022I still care about you and I don\u0027t want us to break up but I feel as though with how my trip went it felt as if things were going how they should\u0027ve but after I got home and things calmed down I feel as though we sped through things way to quick. \n\nI love spending time with you, but the amount of time we spend on call is a little too much for me, it feels like we never have space to do anything for ourselves and reconnect later. \n\nI don\u0027t mind reassuring you, as someone who used to overthink to an extreme due to past experiences, I can empathize how you feel and understand where you\u0027re coming from, however I don\u0027t feel as though I can be in a relationship with someone who needs constant reassurance, it feels as though sometimes it doesn\u0027t matter what I say you\u0027ll spin it in a different light then how I intended and it shifts the mood to the point I feel I\u0027m walking on thin ice with what I say. I\u0027d love to still be in a relationship with you, however I feel it would be best if we took sometime for ourselves to have some space to figure ourselves out, before thinking of getting engaged and married so quickly.\n\nI think for right now we should take things slow, and see how things go in the future to see if we would work out and be compatible not just online but in real life\u0022\n\n  \nWe have talked about meeting up in person and it seems like it\u0027s going to be a sure thing. He\u0027s talked about wanting to get proposed the time we meet as he\u0027s said \u0022I found my person I want to be with\u0022. When I\u0027ve told him that online and real life are two different things he said that we\u0027re on call constantly and that I bring him everywhere I go. Yes that is true however that\u0027s not the same thing as being in person in my opinion. Should I stick it out with him and work through stuff then see how things go in person?",

However, when we started talking I was on a train going from one side of America all the way to the other on September 7th , my train ended up delayed for a good 2\u002B hours and we got talking in a call together. We ended up getting together officially the 14th of September. There\u0026amp;#39;s no way to describe how I felt on that train trip other than that years were passing me by. It felt as though I was on it for 3 years as opposed to it being a 3 day trip to and back. Everything felt as though it was going how it should, however now that I am back home it feels as though we went way too quick too fast. We have only known of eachothers existence since August and we\u0026amp;#39;re already saying \u0026amp;quot;I love you\u0026amp;quot; and talking about marriage. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Keep in mind this is an online relationship, he lives in the UK and I live in the US. I have a script of what I want to say to him, but seeing as he\u0026amp;#39;s an extreme overthinker I\u0026amp;#39;m not sure if I phrased things properly to not come off as toxic or anything. This is what I have prepared to say to him:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026amp;quot;I still care about you and I don\u0026amp;#39;t want us to break up but I feel as though with how my trip went it felt as if things were going how they should\u0026amp;#39;ve but after I got home and things calmed down I feel as though we sped through things way to quick. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I love spending time with you, but the amount of time we spend on call is a little too much for me, it feels like we never have space to do anything for ourselves and reconnect later. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I don\u0026amp;#39;t mind reassuring you, as someone who used to overthink to an extreme due to past experiences, I can empathize how you feel and understand where you\u0026amp;#39;re coming from, however I don\u0026amp;#39;t feel as though I can be in a relationship with someone who needs constant reassurance, it feels as though sometimes it doesn\u0026amp;#39;t matter what I say you\u0026amp;#39;ll spin it in a different light then how I intended and it shifts the mood to the point I feel I\u0026amp;#39;m walking on thin ice with what I say. I\u0026amp;#39;d love to still be in a relationship with you, however I feel it would be best if we took sometime for ourselves to have some space to figure ourselves out, before thinking of getting engaged and married so quickly.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I think for right now we should take things slow, and see how things go in the future to see if we would work out and be compatible not just online but in real life\u0026amp;quot;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We have talked about meeting up in person and it seems like it\u0026amp;#39;s going to be a sure thing. He\u0026amp;#39;s talked about wanting to get proposed the time we meet as he\u0026amp;#39;s said \u0026amp;quot;I found my person I want to be with\u0026amp;quot;. When I\u0026amp;#39;ve told him that online and real life are two different things he said that we\u0026amp;#39;re on call constantly and that I bring him everywhere I go. Yes that is true however that\u0026amp;#39;s not the same thing as being in person in my opinion. Should I stick it out with him and work through stuff then see how things go in person?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",
